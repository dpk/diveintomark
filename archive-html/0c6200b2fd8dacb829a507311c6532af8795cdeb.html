<li id="comment-3608"><p>So, supposing I wanted to be able to compare other XML feeds for diffs with highlighting via a web interface.  How could I do it?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need your code line by line if you&#8217;re not prepared to release it; rather, I&#8217;m just after a logic walk-through.  We grab a feed and isolate entries, (storing each entry in a databse?).  When we next grab the feed, we compare posts (with the same permanent link?  the same pubDate?) and look for diffs and highlight.  I just need a little more specifics before I could roll my own.</p>

<li id="comment-3609"><p>Interesting. I was just talking to my roommate about the ability to track changes in weblog posts and whether it would be a useful feature or not.</p>
<p>The problem is, of course, that unless there is an unbiased and unaffiliated party tracking the changes, then the revision-list history of posts is only as trustworthy as those managing the system &#8211; in your case, only as trustworthy as you.</p>
<p>Regardless, very interesting indeed.</p>

<p>The thing is, though, you&#8217;re right.  It *is* obvious.  Many wikis do it (like MoinMoin, which we&#8217;re using for the Atom project).  Many high-end CMSes do it.  Operating systems have done it for decades (cough, VMS, cough).  Why not weblogs?</p>
<p>(It was also trivial to code.  A few hours tops, and most of that time was spent dicking around on IRC, er, I mean planning.)</p>

<li class=me id="comment-3614"><p>Dan: yup, I still have &#8220;god mode&#8221; over the database and the server its on, so this doesn&#8217;t solve the integrity problem in the long run.  But it adds transparency in the short run; assuming you *already* trust me, you can use this to get more information from me than before.  And if you&#8217;re not sure whether to trust me, I&#8217;m giving you *more information* with which to decide.  (If you already think I&#8217;m the spawn of the devil, well, buh bye.  Don&#8217;t bother to write.  I&#8217;ve gotten enough hate mail from clueless sheep this week.)</p>
<p>I promise never to muck with my own revision history.  It&#8217;ll get messy, especially on those long linkdumps (where I may add new links to the same entry 5 or 10 times throughout the day).  But it&#8217;ll all be there.  The script checks for updates every 60 seconds.  As long as I keep the script running and the history available, I promise I&#8217;ll never muck with it.</p>

<li id="comment-3620"><p>This all looks technically nice and interesting, but what does this have to do with accountability?</p>
<p>Mark you wrote: I promise never to muck with my own revision history.  It�ll get messy&#8230;..</p>
<p>The beauty of the print industry is the static nature of publication &#8212; but they have editors who respond, invariably, with a corrections column. Even those cases are based on an element of trust. </p>
<p>I can understand the fascination when someone on his/her personal site decides to publish something then revises it, to change tone or content. Monitoring that is smart if we can trust the arbiter &#8212; the changes are made, the original is lost, the monitor logs both. Couldn&#8217;t the log be manipulated? You alude to that. Historical engineering can happen on both sides.</p>
<p>I suppose my point is of the &#8216;who watches the watchmen&#8217; ilk, and since you say it&#8217;s a matter of trust then that&#8217;s fine. </p>
<p>On an objective slant this is not accountability since you&#8217;re making yourself accountable through a system *you* control. Whether I or anyone else trusts you isn&#8217;t the point. Accountability only matters to the people who would like to hold you to your words, and by their nature they probably don&#8217;t trust you. Maybe you should revise the title: Dive Into Mark&#8217;s Accountability.</p>

<p>Personally, I trust Mark when he says that he&#8217;s not going to muck around with his revision tracking.  I think that even offering such a service on a personal weblog is a pretty brave step forward.</p>

<li id="comment-3623"><p>Maybe this quote from 1984 would be more appropriate:</p>
<p>&#8220;With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother &#8212; it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which The Times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak &#8212; &#8216;child hero&#8217; was the phrase generally used &#8212; had overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.&#8221;</p>

<li id="comment-3624"><p>The idea of getting post diffs is probably better applied in aggregators. Like others have commented, automated versioning doesn&#8217;t make others accept your accountability when you&#8217;re the one who controls the switch and can turn it on and off.</p>

<li id="comment-3632"><p>re: comment 28, Dave.</p>
<p>I made it explicit that trust is not an issue for people who obviously trust Mark. It falls down when it becomes a matter for people who don&#8217;t trust him. Whether I do or not is beside the point, it holds no consequence regarding my comment.</p>
<p>If the idea is to show changes and evolution of posts then that&#8217;s fine. When it becomes an accountability machine then it patently isn&#8217;t. Where&#8217;s the independence? Lets use an analogue, what would a person who knows nothing about Mark or his motives think? Please don&#8217;t take this the wrong way, but objectivity is the key of accountability. </p>
<p>Quoting Orwell is fine, posit: calling the machine a measure of accountability when its under the control of the person it&#8217;s watching could be considered Orwellian in itself. </p>
<p>Perspective is the right way to go.</p>

<li id="comment-3633"><p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be possible to create a post checksum based on a single post? You&#8217;d have to avoid using the tags so that a layout change wouldn&#8217;t corrupt it, but if different applications had a way of keeping track (such as RSS readers) it would be a way of keeping a revision history without storing the whole page. You could track more sites this way (drawback being that you couldn&#8217;t see what was changed, just be alerted to the fact that it had). Another solution might be for somenoe like technorati to implement it, as then it would apply to a lot of people quickly and easily. Everytime the checksum changes, the post has been edited.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not as technically savvy as the rest of you&#8230; What are the drawbacks to something like this? Besides the fact that everyone is vehemently against having their edits publicized.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-3634"><p>Here&#8217;s the deal with the last modified date:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s MTLastModified (thanks Kevin), so it&#8217;s maintained by MT and can never get out of date.  That&#8217;s a good thing, except that MT updates the entry_modified_on column whenever I save the entry, whether or not there are any changes.  I thought about it and decided *not* to display these in the revision history, because it&#8217;s not useful for my purpose.  The purpose of the revision history is to show when the text /changes/, not just when I click &#8216;save&#8217;.</p>
<p>For example, when I moderate comments, I have to click &#8216;save&#8217; to rebuild the entry afterwards.  At some point I&#8217;ll close the comment thread, and that will require another &#8216;save&#8217;.  And so forth.</p>
<p>I should either make this clear, or remove the MTLastModified display altogether and just rely on the separate revision history page.  Since the system is hacked in and not-quite-real-time (updates on a cron job), I don&#8217;t think I can get a perfectly accurate date-of-actual-last-modification-of-text on the entry page.  Which, given the nature of the feature, will obviously lead to conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>RFC3161, Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol, lays out the principles for a Time Stamping Authority, but folks like <a href="/web/20110608001317/http://time.certum.pl/">http://time.certum.pl/</a> make it available to the common folk, for free.</p>
<p>Certum takes a GET/POST with a field &#8216;sha1&#8242;, time-stamps it, and returns an RFC3161 application/timestamp-reply (an ASN1 blob).  A requestor need only find a format that can be sha1sum&#8217;ed by themselves and others, then Certum notarizes it as having been summed at a certain time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry, maybe I&#8217;m not making it very clear, or if I am it&#8217;s of no consequence.<br />
The question is not whether Mark will be dishonest, it&#8217;s a question of he *could* be dishonest. The capability exists. In a similar vein, a Pilgrim Watcher would have the same problem. In both cases the tools would not be a good measure of accountability. Just because I mention the words Mark and dishonesty in the same sentence it doesn&#8217;t mean I believe they belong together, others may.<br />
The feedster idea could have been a better measure along these lines. If you needed it.</p>

<li id="comment-3648"><p>Bravo, Mark. I think the revision history option is wonderful. I&#8217;m building my own blogging system (sick of Blogger&#8217;s lack of development&mdash;it&#8217;s just not robust and doesn&#8217;t seem to be getting robust anytime soon) and I&#8217;m definitely going to squeeze that feature in. Not for me, of course, because I always clearly demarcate any changes, but I&#8217;m taking someone else&#8217;s blogging system as a base and modifying the hell out of it.</p>

Quoting 1984 because of this whole thing when we&#8217;re in a country that is about to prosecute men on an island somewhere that this country has labeled terrorists.

I wrote the following in another comment:</del></p>
<p><del>Mark sees himself as the persecuted crusader seeking justice in a world controlled by one man. But Mark&#8217;s actions give the control to the one man, and becomes himself the controller through his use of technology.</del></p>

<p><del>In other words &#8212; give me a friggen break. George Orwell because webloggers edit? Quoting 1984 because of Dave Winer shenanigans? Mark, what a compliment to Winer. The ultimate compliment &#8212; you gave him ultimate power.</del></p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;d require changes to MT since it will only send pings automatically when an entry is first published.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-3653"><p>Kevin (of staggernation.com) tells me that MT plugins can hook in as an entry is being created, and could probably do enough to produce a real-time revision history (as opposed to what I&#8217;m doing, which is polling the database for changes every 60 seconds).  Presumably such a plugin could also check that the entry being edited was on the front page, and then call the ping routine to ping whatever pingable services had been configured.</p>
<p>Or I could just be talking out of my ass.  Yes, that seems more likely.</p>

Circumstantial evidence does not equate to weak evidence. I&#8217;m not taking a position on either side of your argument, just pointing out a slight problem with your argument. Sometimes circumstantial evidence is extremely strong and people are sent to prison because of it every day.</p>

<li id="comment-3657"><p>Great concept, particularly for monitoring news  organization sites who are always falling over themselves to publish news first (often at the expense of accuracy). Would have been great to have something like this on 9-11 keeping track of all of the reports with inconsistencies  that I saw live but that were never mentioned again.</p>
<p>As far as monitoring Dave Winer is concerned, I&#8217;m not sure that many people really care. I&#8217;m sure the page will get a lot of hits from people curious to see how it works, but few are gonna be checking it regularly.</p>
<p>As far as what it does to the monitored poster: I don&#8217;t think something that makes someone think a bit more carefully before choosing words is really such a bad thing. If we were publishing to PAPER instead of the web, we&#8217;d make darn sure our thoughts were in order, spelling and grammar correct, etc.  It seems that publishing to the web just lets us be a little bit sloppier/impulsive. Realizing that our errors may be caught for posterity only gives us more incentive to get it right the first time. I don&#8217;t see how it can be construed at evil or something terrible to do to our neighbor, particularly if our neighbor is in the habit of saying he didn&#8217;t say things that he in reality did say.</p>

<li id="comment-3658"><p>The &#8220;revision history&#8221; concept is worthwhile, but the flap about the &#8220;Winer Watcher&#8221; wasn&#8217;t about the technical merits of revision tracking. Looking at it from the standpoint of enforcing accountability is only one side of the coin; the other side is that it prevents someone who has that accountability forced upon them from ever reconsidering their words. Sometimes an addition isn&#8217;t enough: if you&#8217;ve posted something in the heat of anger, perhaps, and you&#8217;ve said things you regret, you can&#8217;t take them down.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re to leave Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s personality out of this and abstract it, that means we have to leave Dave Winer&#8217;s personality out as well&#8211;as well as his record in revision without notation. The tool itself and the concept for tracking revisions on weblogs is fine, but the tool doesn&#8217;t address the ethical issue of whether one person should track someone else&#8217;s website, without their consent, to highlight all changes made. I don&#8217;t recall ever deleting a post on my own weblog nor making any substantive edits, but if I learned someone&#8211;particularly someone I might have had public spats with in the recent past&#8211;was tracking my words that closely, I would be pretty uncomfortable.</p>

<li id="comment-3660"><p>I agree that while Winer Watcher per se has little value to most people (and great value to an ever growing niche) the idea has broader application.</p>
<p>Monitor governemnt websites for changes in content.  Monitor the HR page @ yourcompany to see when those policies change.  Specific to blogs, as more and more politicians use them as a tool, the ability to monitor edits becomes a valuable tool for muckraking.</p>
<p>And the merits of monitoring FoxNews or the NY Times for edits in stories are self-evident.</p>

<p>Mark, I should have some code to send you by tomorrow. Hadn&#8217;t thought about including a template tag to display the number of revisions, but it&#8217;s a good idea and should be easy to stick in&#8230;</p>

<p>I always thought it&#8217;s a shame INS and DEL can&#8217;t be &#8220;embedded&#8221; in things like list items. Luckily, XHTML 2 solves that.</p>
