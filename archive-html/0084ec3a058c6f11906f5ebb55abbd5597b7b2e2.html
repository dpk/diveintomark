<meta name="description" content="This is a brief history of RSS from July 2000 to November 2000, during which time RSS 0.9x and RSS 1.0 forked. I try to focus on specific people and conversations that document why the fork occurred. I was not involved in any of this, but much (not all) of the discussion has been publicly archived. So this is very much an outsider's history, and like any history, it is necessarily biased, selective, and incomplete.">

<blockquote><p>Perhaps the key benefit of RSS is its simplicity. The syntax for the format is easy to understand, and there are only a few self-explanatory tags to learn. This makes RSS files relatively trivial to produce. Dave Winer of Userland has recently added some new <a href="/web/20110806114859/http://backend.userland.com/rss091">online documentation for RSS 0.91</a>, adding historical notes as well as capturing details of its common usage patterns.</p>
<p>Developers on the RSS and Syndication mailing lists are now discussing future directions for RSS, the hope being to build on current successes and provide richer functionality.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: RSS (&#8220;RDF Site Summary&#8221;) is a lightweight multipurpose
extensible metadata description and syndication format. RSS is
an XML application, conforms to the W3C&#8217;s RDF Specification
and is extensible via XML-namespace and/or RDF based modularization.</p>
<p>Design Goals: The modular extension of existing RSS through XML Namespaces and RDF
stressing backward compatibility with RSS 0.9 for ease of adoption
by existing syndicated content producers.</p>

newly-created RSS-DEV mailing list at: <a href="/web/20110806114859/http://www.egroups.com/group/rss-dev">http://www.egroups.com/group/rss-dev</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[addressing Dave Winer] If I understand you correctly, you want to create a set of elements for RSS
that are widely supported and you&#8217;re free to do that. Just create your own
namespace and tie it into the proposal. You say namespaces are confusing,
but I have to disagree with you there. When used properly, they can actually
make XML easier to understand.</p>
<p>&#8230; RSS is now (or once again) an RDF format, which has its benefits and
drawbacks. It does make RSS more complicated, which is a downside. However,
as R.V. Guha pointed out to me, you can easily escape from RDF if you don&#8217;t
like it by using the rdf:parseType=&#8221;literal&#8221; attribute. Again, I think this
is likely a best-of-both-worlds move.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>To enable the average developer to cope, a syndication format must
be simple to create and be easily read by a human. The rdf approach
requires too much studying and background knowledge to easily pick up
and is too hard for humans to read and create manually.</li>
<li>RSS should also be easy to parse and create using any software
environment which developers care to use. Some software environments
are too weak to handle RDF and the namespace syntax.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#8230; If the RDF approach is to be widely accepted and adopted then 1) and
2) require solutions. Not all of them may be technical, but better
software tools support is part of a solution which does not require
the simple syntax required by the &#8220;expanded core&#8221;. This software
tools support should span *all* of the environments which people need
to use&#8230; and we shouldn&#8217;t sneer at people who try to parse this

<blockquote><p>I think the answer from the RSS-DEV people (I&#8217;m sort of guessing, correct me
if I&#8217;m wrong) is that the writers shouldn&#8217;t have to understand the spec &#8211;
they should be able to use tools that will generate the RSS for them.</p>
<p>&#8230; The fact is, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, nobody but the programmers should have
to deal with these specs. There seems to be a lot of confusion here, that
RSS files are meant to be written by hand. Perhaps that was true with the
old spec, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be, and is even less true with the new one.
The specs are written for programmers, to allow them to write programs that
communicate.</p>
<p>&#8230; To the writers &#8212; don&#8217;t worry, we haven&#8217;t forgotten about you. In fact, we
care about you more than ever. You don&#8217;t need to be messing with the XML by
hand &#8212; that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s designed for, it&#8217;s designed for programs. We&#8217;ve
tried to create programs so that you don&#8217;t have to generate the RSS file by
hand, you can convert to it or do it through a web interface. If you still
have trouble, let us know, we&#8217;re here to help, not to scare.</p></blockquote>

<p>People want to (and should) understand the technologies that they use. So
when you build a format that puts required namespace declarations in the

<blockquote><p>I maintain that the new [proposed RSS 1.0] spec is for more technical usage than
the older one. For real heavy-duty use, it will require some understanding
of XML and RDF. The benefit from this is more power, but at the expense of
some clarity and simplicity. I see RSS as moving away from a simple XML
language for the people, and more towards a communication system for content
management systems and other scripting environments. It may not be the
choice you believe in, but it&#8217;s a choice that the authors are making. There
will always be other formats if you don&#8217;t agree.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I was the primary author of the RSS 0.9 and 0.91 spec and the architect behind the My Netscape Network. &#8230; I was the primary author of the RSS 0.9 and 0.91 spec and the architect behind the My Netscape Network (a separate project from My Netscape, which I also worked on). I left Netscape in 1999, in part because of what I felt was mis-handling (non-handling?) of RSS and the MN platform. I fully expected the format to die an ignominious death, and I was pleasantly surprised to recently to poke my head out of the sand and find so many people still using it. I am glad that the net community has begun adopting RSS, and would like to see it realize the original vision.</p>
<p>The original My Netscape Network Vision:</p>
<p>We would create a platform and an RDF vocabulary for syndicating metadata about websites and aggregating them on My Netscape and ultimately in the web browser. Because we only retrieved metadata, the website authors would still receive user&#8217;s click-throughs to view the full site, thus benefitting both the aggregator and the publisher. My Netscape would run an RDF database that stored all the content. Preferences akin to mail filters, would allow the user to filter only the data in which they are interested onto the page, from the entire pool of data. For example, a user interested in articles about &#8220;Football&#8221; would be able to setup a personalized channel that simply consisted of a filter for Football, or even for a particular team or player. Or for all references to Slashdot.org, or whatever. This fit our personalization scheme well, and would (I hoped) give us the largest selection of content, with the greatest degree of personalization available. Tools would be made available to simplify the process of creating these files, and to validate them, and life would be good.</p>
<p>What Actually Happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>A decision was made that for the first implementation, we did not actually need a &#8220;real&#8221; RDF database, which did not even really exist at the time. Instead we could put the data in our existing store, and instead display data, one &#8220;channel&#8221; at a time. This made publishers happier anyway, because they would get their own window and logo. We could always do the &#8220;full&#8221; implementation later.</li>
<li>The original RDF/RSS spec was deemed &#8220;too complex&#8221; for the &#8220;average user&#8221;. The RDF data model itself is complex to the uninitiated, and thus the placement of certain XML elements representing arc types seemed redundant and arbitrary to some. Support for XML namespaces was basically non-existent. My (poor) solution was to create a simpler format, RSS 0.9, that was technically valid RDF, but dropped namespaces and created a non-connected graph. &#8230; This marked the beginning of the Full Functionality vs Keep It Simple Stupid debate that continues to this day. &#8230;</li>
<li>We shipped the first implementation, sans tools. Basically, there was a spec for RSS 0.9, some samples, and a web-based validation tool.  No further support was given for a while&#8230;</li>
<li>At some point, it was decided that we needed to rev the RSS spec to allow things like per item descriptions, i18n support, ratings, and image widths and height. Due to artificial (in my view) time constraints, it was again decided to continue with the current storage solution, and I realized that we were *never* going to get around to the rest of the project as originally conceived. At the time, the primary users of RSS (Dave Winer the most vocal among them) were asking why it needed to be so complex and why it didn&#8217;t have support for various features, eg update frequencies. We really had no good answer, given that we weren&#8217;t using RDF for any useful purpose. &#8230;</li>
<li>We shipped the thing in a very short time, meeting the time constraints, then spent a month or two fixing it all. :-) &#8230;</li>
<li>People on the net began creating all sorts of tools on their own, and publishing how-to articles, and all sorts of things, and using it in ways not envisioned by, err, some. And now we are here, debating it all over again.</li>

<blockquote><p>The format and process they describe are highly complex. They are over-estimating content people&#8217;s technical sophistication and interest in working on new formats.</p>
<p>IMHO, the new format should not be called RSS. There&#8217;s been a fork, and the peaceful solution is to each go our own way. Calling their spec RSS is unfair. We never considered moving RSS forward without getting O&#8217;Reilly on board first. RSS 1.0 was a surprise, we found out when the spec went public. I&#8217;ve said this over and over to the O&#8217;Reilly people, I would wish them godspeed if they hadn&#8217;t called it RSS. Should we call our spec RSS 1.0 too?</p>
<p>BTW, it was Netscape&#8217;s decision to take the RDF out of RSS, one we heartily supported. We considered calling it Really Simple Syndication. That&#8217;s the core thing about RSS, simplicity, it&#8217;s almost an end-user format, easily explained in a four-screen spec designed for people who understand HTML and not much more.

it. Having two RSS 1.0&#8242;s would be even more confusing. I think the name is
also deserved, considering the large amount of work spent on making the new
spec backwards-compatible with RSS 0.9. It would be different if their we
were creating a radically new spec, but we&#8217;re not &#8212; instead we&#8217;re simply
adding namespaces and more RDF support to an already existing spec.</p>

<blockquote><p>Speaking of RSS, here&#8217;s my read on what happened. (I wasn&#8217;t directly involved.) A group of people involved in RSS got together to start thinking about its future evolution. Dave was part of the group. When the consensus of the group turned in a direction he didn&#8217;t like, Dave stopped participating, and characterized it as a plot by O&#8217;Reilly to take over RSS from him, despite the fact that Rael Dornfest of O&#8217;Reilly was only one of about a dozen authors of the proposed RSS 1.0 spec, and that many of those who were part of its development had at least as long a history with RSS as Dave had. The only connection I can see is that the O&#8217;Reilly Network ran a series of ads on our sites promoting its stories about the RSS 1.0 spec (just as it promotes other stories on O&#8217;Reilly Network sites). Dave never approached me directly to express a point of view such as &#8220;I think the RSS spec is going in the wrong direction. Is there anything you can do to help get my point of view across to the other developers?&#8221; Instead, the first I heard of it was a series of public accusations that my company was leading a conspiracy to steal &#8220;Dave&#8217;s&#8221; standard. </p></blockquote>

<p>Let me ask you a straight question. If it turns out that the plan to call the new spec &#8220;RSS 1.0&#8243; was done in private, without any heads-up or consultation, or for a chance for the Syndication list members to agree or disagree, not just me, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>UserLand did a lot of work to create and popularize and support RSS. We walked away from that, and let your guys have the name. That&#8217;s the top level. If I want to do any further work in Web syndication, I have to use a different name. Why and how did that happen Tim?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As I understand it, it was public knowledge (or certainly your knowledge) that there was work going on on a spec to extend RSS. When it was published, it was published as a &#8220;proposed RSS 1.0 spec&#8221;, and that seems completely legitimate to me, whether or not the work to develop it was done in public or private. The dozen people who worked on it have enough history with RSS to propose anything they like. You personally urged Rael to start the effort to write up what he was thinking as a proposed spec. And a &#8220;proposed RSS 1.0 spec&#8221; seems like as good a description as any for what they had come up with.</p>
<p>It seems to me that you immediately hardened the battle lines, and started crying foul, when you should instead have said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that this is the right direction for RSS 1.0.&#8221; If you&#8217;d kept yourself to technical substance instead of vague (and incorrect) accusations of plots masterminded by O&#8217;Reilly, this whole contretemps could have been avoided.</p>
<p>As Lao Tzu says, &#8220;He who feels pricked, must first have been a bubble.&#8221; I believe it was your power grab to unilaterally rewrite the RSS 0.91 spec with a Userland copyright that actually started this whole thing. You were moving to claim RSS as &#8220;yours&#8221; and a group of other developers put an oar in, and you didn&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>&#8230; By any outside reading, your claim to have &#8220;created&#8221; RSS has no basis. Dan Brickley&#8217;s posts to FoRK, the first of which I linked to above, make that fairly clear. Netscape created it, but even then, it is so similar to other things available at the time from a number of players, including Microsoft, that anyone&#8217;s claim to ownership are pretty thin. Netscape created the name, and that&#8217;s about as close as you can get. You certainly did a lot of work to popularize and support it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Tim, when I posted my &#8220;RSS&#8221; 0.91 spec, I could have left out the OK-To-Copy copyright. The copyright applied to the writing, not the underlying format, as it clearly states. Had I left that copyright out, you wouldn&#8217;t have been able to take the text and use it on another site. Talk about &#8220;no good deed going unpunished.&#8221;</p>
<p>That spec was done openly and was only documenting current practice. There was lots of feedback. If people had problems with me doing it at the time, they didn&#8217;t tell me, in fact there are comments under the spec from Rael and others, where they&#8217;re helping. If they had a problem with the copyright, this is the first I&#8217;m hearing about it.</p>
<p>I would think that you of all people would appreciate the generosity of a copyright that allows people to steal my work. The agreement was derived from the copyright that&#8217;s on IETF RFCs. It&#8217;s stood the test of time, it&#8217;s fair, not something to freak out over. And as I said, no one freaked out at the time.</p></blockquote>

However, I did hear from a number of people (not those involved in the proposed RSS 1.0 spec) that they thought at the time that reissuing the RSS 0.91 spec with a userland copyright was a bit tacky. I can understand why you did it, though, and I don&#8217;t have a problem with it. </p></blockquote>

one asked &#8220;Is it OK if we call this RSS 1.0?&#8221;</p>
<p>The great thing about eGroups is that no one can tamper with the record. If

<blockquote><p>Contrary to what you might hear, the RSS 1.0 proposal did not come from
a bunch of outsiders who swooped in and grabbed the prestigious acronym
&#8216;RSS&#8217;. RSS 1.0 as proposed is solidly grounded in the original RSS
vision, which itself had a long heritage going back to MCF (an RDF
precursor) and related specs (CDF etc). This can be seen for
example from Guha&#8217;s longstanding involvement, and Dan Libby&#8217;s account of
the Netscape RSS work and endorsement of the 1.0 proposal.</p>
<p>&#8230; I believe we have more than adequate historical justification for
calling the &#8216;new&#8217; stuff RSS. To defend this observation requires
pointing to a bunch of historical baggage that I&#8217;ve previously avoided
publicising.</p>
<p>&#8230; On the basis of these various observations, we have two
traditions, both rooted in Guha&#8217;s MCF work.</p>

<p>MCF &gt; XML-MCF &gt; RSS 0.90 &gt; RSS 1.0</p>
<p>&#8230; To stress my point once more. The RSS 1.0 proposal did not appear from
out of nowhere, but is routed in 5 years work in this area. The
RSS 1.0 proposers did not swoop in from nowhere to steal the &#8216;RSS&#8217;
