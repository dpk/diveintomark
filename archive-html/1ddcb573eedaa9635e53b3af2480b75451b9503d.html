<p>And now, the part of the show where I make fun of stupid people who hate me.</p>

<p>In personal news, my parents went to Africa to go to safari in the Seren&#8230; to go on a safari in the Sereng&#8230; safari in the Sereng&#8230; to go on a safari&#8230; to go on a safari in the Serengeti.  Then my father stayed behind for a week to help build houses in Zambia with Habitat for Humanity.  That&#8217;s really cool.  He&#8217;s helped build houses all over the world: El Salvador, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, and now Zambia.  Traveling to other countries really puts things into perspective.  For example, I am never complaining about my commute again.</p>

<li id="comment-7088"><p>Yay!  A video format that plays on this crappy XP-laden PC!  VLC just wouldn&#8217;t play all of those other videos that I found here.  Sure, it played the sound, but Mark&#8217;s face was a big gray square.  The background and foreground were the sameshade of gray.  The quicktime is much better.  Nice to see your face, Mark.<br />
Now here&#8217;s what I was wondering the whole time I was watching that video: Did you make the quicktime file on your new Ubuntu box?  And if so, how did you do it?</p>

<li id="comment-7090"><p>Woah! How did you get the The 9 to work with Ubuntu?  I just get complaints about needing to update to Flash 8.  I can hear her&#8230; just can&#8217;t see her&#8230;</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7091"><p>> How did you get the The 9 to work with Ubuntu?</p>
<p>Firefox under Wine, then let Yahoo auto-install Flash 8.  I told you it was a guilty pleasure. :)</p>
<p>> Did you make the quicktime file on your new Ubuntu box?</p>
<p>No, although I&#8217;ve been researching how to do this.  It is allegedly possible (for example, iSquint on Mac OS X is &#8220;just&#8221; a wrapper for ffmpeg &#8212; except that it&#8217;s not anymore, it runs ffmpeg and then forces the resulting file through a Quicktime passthrough to be compatible with the iPod 1.1 firmware).  Anyway, for the time being, I am physically able to transfer DV files over to my old Mac (which is still in the house and in working order), so I imported it into iMovie and exported it to H.264.  No subtitles, sorry.  No doubt Quicktime has its own way of doing subtitles, but I haven&#8217;t looked into it yet.</p>
<p>> Now if we could just get you to use a better microphone</p>
<p>I actually have a Shure SM57 with a Behringer Eurorack UB802 mixer.  What I don&#8217;t have is a clip mic for doing video.  Any suggestions?</p>
<p class=sig>&#8212;&#8201;<cite><a href='/web/20110806104548/http://diveintomark.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Mark</a></cite>&#160;<a class=p href="/web/20110806104548/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/07/16/fly#comment-7091" title="July 16, 2006 @ 7:56 pm"><img alt="#" src=/web/20110806104548im_/http://wearehugh.com/h.png width=8 height=9></a></li>
<li id="comment-7092"><p>If you want to stick with Shure, it looks like the best deal is the SM93:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether that comes with a separate phantom power supply, but it doesn&#8217;t matter, because the Behringer can supply the phantom power for you.     In addition, you&#8217;ll have to see whether the Shure preamp or the mixer&#8217;s preamp sounds better.</p>

<p>Thanks for the MP4 file, anyway, as I have approximately a million tools and devices that will play those back, versus a choice between VLC, VLC, and VLC for the Matroska files.  OK, I guess Mplayer technically works as well, but um, pain. :)</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7094"><p>> Subtitles maybe via QuickTime text tracks?</p>
<p>Thanks for the link.  I&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s a relatively painless way to convert my existing subtitles and insert it into my existing .mp4 file without remastering it.</p>
<p>> Thanks for the MP4 file, anyway</p>
<p>You&#8217;re welcome.  Zealotry is overrated, and I&#8217;ve just given up on the idea of having a technically superior, legally unencumbered, Free Software-friendly, easy-to-use video podcast.  The final straw was showing my wife <a href="/web/20110806104548/http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy Player</a> on her-that-used-to-be-my PowerBook and discovering that my videos wouldn&#8217;t play.  Apparently, Democracy embeds VLC on Windows and Linux, but on Mac OS X it uses Quicktime like every other Mac app in the world.  Sigh.  I give up.</p>
<p>(BTW, I can watch embedded Quicktime movies in my browser on my Ubuntu box too.  sudo aptitude install mozilla-mplayer.)</p>

<li id="comment-7095"><p>Counting to ten in another language? Not so impressive! Saying &#8220;Tipping Point&#8221; and reciting the RFC key words (&#8220;MUST&#8221;, &#8220;MUST NOT&#8221;, &#8220;REQUIRED&#8221;) the way kids can recite state-of-being verbs (be, being, been). Impressive!</p>
<p>Speaking of MUST NOT, when&#8217;s your parenting book coming out?</p>
<p>Have you heard about People Aggregator? Aggregating people sounds really scary! Hide behind a wall in your house and when your little one turns the corner, yell &#8220;People Aggregator&#8221; and see if he/she doesn&#8217;t poop their diaper. Contrast with &#8220;Boo!&#8221;.</p>

<li id="comment-7099"><p>Three things:</p>
<p>1.) After the brouhaha with John Gruber it&#8217;s nice to see that you&#8217;re wearing a Daring Fireball T-shirt.  Making nice or rubbing salt?  Either way, I thought it was funny.</p>
<p>2.) Convert input video to iPod-ready files with ffmpeg (havne&#8217;t done it in awhile)<br />

<p>3.) I liked the &#8220;technically superior, legally unencumbered, Free Software-friendly, easy-to-use video podcast&#8221;.  Being a longtime Debian user, I&#8217;ve gotten used to manually downloading media or dropping to the command line and forcing mplayer to play the link.  Are the Mac elite too proud to right-click (or control-click) the link and paste it into VLC?  (Before any of you Mac zealouts start to go crazy, I work in digital prepress and work with Macs daily, they are not a panacea, get over it).</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7109"><p>OK, I&#8217;ve normalized the presentation of the download links on all 3 episodes.  Clicking the bunny picture now takes you to the Quicktime version, which plays in your browser unless you&#8217;ve done something wacky to disable that.  The feed now also links to the Quicktime version, which is already iPod-compatible, so you iTunes/iPodder/whatever users can just subscribe and sync up without any transcoding.</p>
<p>As for the Matroska versions, I&#8217;ve remastered all of them in a larger size *and* higher bitrate, so they should look and sound better than ever.  I&#8217;ve added a link to the downloads page on matroska.org which provides an up-to-date list of compatible players for every platform.  I didn&#8217;t even realize there was a &#8220;Matroska pack&#8221; of codecs for Windows.  That&#8217;s pretty slick.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7123"><p>OK, so I figured out the MP4 caption thing.  It&#8217;s not QuickTime-specific, since .mp4 is an ISO standard container format (as opposed to .mov).  The solution is <a href="/web/20110806104548/http://gpac.sourceforge.net/auth_text.php">MP4Box</a>, which can take an existing .mp4 file with audio and video tracks, and an existing .srt caption file, and convert the .srt file into &#8220;3GPP timed text&#8221; format and insert it into the .mp4 file appropriately.</p>
<p>MP4Box -add existing.mp4 -add subtitles.srt:lang=en new.mp4</p>
<p>Pretty simple, and if existing.mp4 played on a video iPod, then new.mp4 does too.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the iPod doesn&#8217;t actually display the captions.  Neither does QuickTime Player.  Neither does the QuickTime browser plugin.  Neither does MPlayer.  Media Player Classic on Windows *does* display them (assuming you have the relevant video and audio codecs installed to play existing.mp4, of course).  VLC displays them too (not by default, but you can select &#8220;Track 1 [english]&#8221; from the Subtitles submenu).</p>
<p>The development version of MP4Box can also allegedly add the title/artist/album tags that iTunes stores/displays.  There are other Free Software programs that can tag video as well, for example AtomicParsley and mp4tags.  Also, some smart people have gotten mencoder to encode iPod-compatible H.264 video.  I haven&#8217;t tried any of these yet, but in theory it should be possible to do everything I want to do with Free Software.</p>
<p>But honestly, I really don&#8217;t see the point (to the captions, not the Free Software part ;-) ).  If QuickTime doesn&#8217;t display them and the iPod doesn&#8217;t display them, it&#8217;ll just confuse people to label the videos as having captions (like I labeled the Matroska files as &#8220;CC&#8221;) when the primary software that 99% of the world uses to watch the videos won&#8217;t display captions.</p>
<p>I realize I&#8217;m out on the frontier in terms of trying to distribute accessible video on the web, but honestly, this seems like a really basic flaw in QuickTime.  And it&#8217;s really hard to find any documentation on this, because all the disability sites that talk about QuickTime captioning are .mov-specific.  It&#8217;s possible that there&#8217;s some hidden option that I&#8217;m missing, but if so, it&#8217;s really well-hidden.  Feh.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7124"><p>The consensus on the web seems to be to burn the captions into the video while encoding it.  mencoder can allegedly do this.  Apple&#8217;s tools can not (at least not the ones I have), so that blows the &#8220;just transfer the .DV over to the old Mac and export from iMovie&#8221; method out of the water.  Once I get mencoder to create iPod-compatible video (which I want to do in any case, as my current method sucks and everything else is already automated), I may experiment with burning the captions as well.</p>
<p>What do y&#8217;all think?  Would you prefer burned-in captions?  Too distracting?  I watch all my DVDs and TV shows with captions/subtitles, and I miss them when they&#8217;re not available (damn you Sesame Street!) so I&#8217;m not the best judge of how distracting they are.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7138"><p>> &#8230; may do the trick for burning in subtitles</p>
<p>Thanks, but the more I research this, the more I&#8217;m convinced that it&#8217;s a bad idea.  The video players I use the most (mplayer and VLC) have lots of different options to control the display of text-based subtitle streams, and burning them into the video obviously negates all of that.  Plus (and this is something I hadn&#8217;t considered until I read about it on the mplayer-users list and tried it myself), burning in subtitles really screws with your encoding quality, because you have these characters with sharp edges that never move, floating &#8220;on top&#8221; of scenes with regular motion.  Video encoders just aren&#8217;t equipped to handle that sort of case, and both the subtitles themselves and the scene behind them suffer for it.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve resigned myself to the irony of publishing &#8220;accessible&#8221; QuickTime movies that QuickTime doesn&#8217;t actually support.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I&#8217;ve refined a script for creating high quality, closed captioned, QuickTime-compatible, iPod-compatible, iTunes-tagged videos using entirely Free Software (specifically ffmpeg, mp4creator, and MP4Box).  It actually produces better-looking video than QuickTime&#8217;s H.264 exporter.  The visual quality difference is especially noticeable in those cutaway scenes where I just show a screenshot of a web page.  I&#8217;ll post a side-by-side comparison shortly, along with the complete script for encoding the video and audio, muxing in the captions from a separate file, and adding tags that iTunes understands.  Plus (and this is really amazing, given the quality difference) the file size of ffmpeg&#8217;s .mp4 file is actually about 5% *smaller* than the .mp4 file I created with QuickTime, despite the fact that (according to mp4creator) both files are identical in dimensions and bitrate.  Plus the movie has a separate track for captions, which is important to me for obvious reasons.  I never could figure out how to add them to an MP4 file with QuickTime; apparently it&#8217;s one of those things that&#8217;s hard to Google for.  (&#8220;quicktime captions&#8221; brings up tutorials from all the usual suspects, but I believe these techniques are specific to Apple&#8217;s .mov container and not applicable to the newer .mp4 container.  And &#8220;quicktime captions mp4&#8243; brings up a lot of sites hawking shady video encoders for Windows.)</p>

<p>It sounds like you have it nailed ;) Very weird about the lower memory footprint despite equivalent bitrate and dimension. That&#8217;s one for the textbook..</p>
<p>For some reason I&#8217;ve never looked at mp4creator. It&#8217;s really great, cheers.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7144"><p>> So I&#8217;ve resigned myself to the irony of publishing &#8220;accessible&#8221; QuickTime movies that QuickTime doesn&#8217;t actually support.</p>
<p>I take it all back.  On a fluke while looking for something else, I stumbled across <a href="/web/20110806104548/http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?p=36312" rel="nofollow">this thread in the VLC forums</a> where a commenter pointed out that QuickTime supports 3GPP timed text, but only in .3gp files.  (It also pointed me to <a href="/web/20110806104548/http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QT6_3/index.html" rel="nofollow">Apple&#8217;s 3GPP documentation</a>, which is very good.)</p>
<p>Curious, I researched 3GPP a little further and learned that it&#8217;s &#8220;similar&#8221; to MPEG-4 (in ways I don&#8217;t fully understand).  However, in the niche field of captioning, 3GPP timed text in .3gp files is *identical* to 3GPP timed text in .mp4 files.  Digging even further, I discovered that I could simply rename foo-with-captions.mp4 to foo-with-captions.3gp and QuickTime would magically start displaying captions&#8230; even in-browser!  Change it back to .mp4, no captions.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse.  QuickTime can play the file either way (with a .3gp file extension or a .mp4 extension), and therefore QuickTime-based programs like iTunes can play the file either way.  But if you try to transfer the files to your iPod, iTunes only transfers the .mp4 file &#8212; despite the fact that the files are identical in everything but file extension!  (No, it wasn&#8217;t because I had two identical videos in my library so it only copied one of them.  I imported one, tried to sync the iPod, deleted it, then imported the other, etc.)  No dice.  iTunes will transfer .mp4 files to your iPod, but it won&#8217;t transfer identical .3gp files.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse.  I want to put these videos on the web, and the web has the concept of MIME types independent of file extensions.  The QuickTime plugin registers itself as the handler for certain MIME types, like video/mp4 or video/3gpp.  This is how your browser knows that a certain file  should be handled by a particular plugin.  It&#8217;s not based on file extension, it&#8217;s entirely based on MIME type (except when it isn&#8217;t, but never mind that).  I set up my server to serve .mp4 files as video/mp4 and .3gp files as video/3gpp.  QuickTime is set up by default to handle both of these MIME types, so it plays both files&#8230; but it only displays captions on the .3gp file.</p>
<p>OK, so my next step was to try to trick QuickTime into displaying captions for the .mp4 file, by serving it up with the video/3gpp MIME type.  Nope, that doesn&#8217;t work either&#8230; QuickTime launches and correctly plays the video, but doesn&#8217;t display captions.  (This is very bad and un-web-like.  The QuickTime plugin registers itself based on MIME types, but then ignores the MIME type and keys off the file extension to figure out what to actually do once it&#8217;s running.)</p>
<p>To sum up, I can use 100% Free Software to create closed captioned videos based on ISO standards</p>
<p>1. that QuickTime can play in your browser with captions, OR<br />
2. that you can sync to your iPod</p>
<p>BUT, because QuickTime respects file extensions over MIME types, I can not do both at the same time.</p>

<li id="comment-7145"><p>I couldn&#8217;t get QT to play the video (on XP), either in the browser or by downloading it.  However, I could open it in VLC, and it played better than the .mkv file.  I decided to change the registered handler for .mp4 files to VLC.</p>
<p>The subset of files that are alotted to closed applications (like WM Player and QT) is slowly shrinking as I find open applications like VLC and Audacity that can do the job.</p>
<p>A couple of beefs with VLC: (1) it crashes much too often, and (2) it often opens a little command window when you&#8217;re playing something in the browser.  Once this window is closed, your browser goes too.</p>

<li id="comment-7167"><p>Just for record &#8212; kaffeine 0.8.1, libxine 1.1.1 and no subtitles (it requires to set me channel where subtitles are &#8212; does it make any sense?), but the rest is fine and I actually don&#8217;t need subtitles. It probably just tries to use some really crappy W32.</p>
<p>No luck with ffplay &#8212; again totally scewed colors. But it happens with other video as well, so it&#8217;s probably my fault.</p>
<p>Nice,</p>
<p>Matěj</p>

<li id="comment-7170"><p>Correction it can play subtitles if you open .srt file with kaffeine (it can apparently find out .mp4 file, but not other way around &#8212; even though it asks which source of subtitles it should use and points specifically to .srt file). Weird.</p>

<li id="comment-7200"><p>First, I just watched the bunny-juana video.  Nicely done.  As I can see above, technical questions are not completely frowned upon. I&#8217;m having trouble getting mp4&#8242;s to play in Safari.  You&#8217;ve done it.  Can you tell me how?  At this point, clicking on the file link results in what seems to be a text printout of the binary file.  I realize that you&#8217;ve got quite a bit of discussion on and around this issue already, but from what I can tell, it&#8217;s focused mostly on adding subtitles.  Any help or linkage or chastising is welcome</p>
