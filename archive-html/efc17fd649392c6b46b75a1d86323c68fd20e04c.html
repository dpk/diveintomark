<p>As part of my <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/11/03/the-pursuit-of-happiness">pursuit of happiness</a>, I have been steadily <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/24/attachments-2">shedding attachments</a>, getting rid of things I don&#8217;t use, <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://mark.pilgrim.usesthis.com/">thinking about ways of keeping the things I do use longer</a>, and just generally being a pain in the ass. This, for instance, is an actual conversation I had with my wife last fall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herself: What do you want for your birthday?</p>
<p>Myself: Nothing.</p>
<p>Her: You&#8217;re impossible to shop for.</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, I would just like to point out that the title of this post is a <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone">snowclone</a>, which itself is a word that I learned in the process of researching the exact wording of the original phrase of which it is a snowclone (&#8220;Math is hard. Let&#8217;s go shopping!&#8221; from <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie#Controversies">Teen Talk Barbie</a> circa 1992). Not knowing whether I should write &#8220;simplicity is hard&#8221; or &#8220;simplicity is tough,&#8221; I searched Google for <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://www.google.com/search?&ie=UTF-8&q=%22let's+go+shopping%22+math+barbie">&#8220;let&#8217;s go shopping&#8221; math barbie</a>, and the first result was a Language Log article called <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002892.html">Tracking snowclones is hard. Let&#8217;s go shopping!</a> which is both self-referential in the obvious sense, and also wonderfully meta-referential in that Language Log <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.html">was instrumental in coining the word &#8220;snowclone&#8221;</a> in the first place, but now can not possibly keep track of the snowclones, as seen by the lengthy update to that very post &#8220;added for those who find this via the Wikipedia entry for &#8216;snowclone&#8217;,&#8221; which would be&#8230; me. And damn it, now I&#8217;ve spent the last two hours on a <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WikiWalk">wiki walk</a>. (And <em>now</em> I&#8217;ve (re)introduced you to TvTropes, so, you know, there goes your evening and most of your night. Try to come up for air before dawn.)</p>

<p>My point, such that I have one, is that simplicity is easy to describe but difficult to achieve. Especially (though not exclusively) when there are other people in your life. While I applaud <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/7190750/Millionaire-gives-away-fortune-that-made-him-miserable.html">millionaires who decide to give away all their money</a> (I say &#8220;their&#8221; money instead of &#8220;his&#8221; money, since even if he made the bulk of it, I can&#8217;t imagine him being able to give it away without his wife&#8217;s consent), the reality at home is more droll. Take, for instance, the television in our bedroom. It is small, as televisions go, costing no more than $100. It was once hooked up to a <abbr>DVD</abbr> player, which itself cost less than $50. Our children used to congregate in our bedroom after bath and before bed and watch 10 or 15 minutes worth of a movie or Sesame Street or some similar passive entertainment. I say &#8220;used to,&#8221; because in truth they stopped doing that about a year ago. No particular reason, just changing patterns. I pointed out to my wife that this would be a perfect opportunity to simplify by getting rid of the television and replacing it with nothing. That conversation went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myself: Can we get rid of this television?</p>
<p>Herself: No.</p>
<p>Me: But we never use it anymore.</p>
<p>Her: I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s not true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I did what any self-respecting scientist would do when faced with an untested hypothesis: I devised a test. Which is to say, I unplugged it. The television. The power cord winds its way to a wall socket behind a dresser, which itself has to be moved in order to get at the socket, so my trickery was both non-obvious and difficult to counteract even if one should notice it. Which, of course, no one did. So there it sat, unused and unplugged, for over six months. Until one day, or rather one night, when we found ourselves in an old familiar situation &#8212; kids in pajamas, jumping on the bed, and so on &#8212; and my wife actually tried to pop in a <abbr>DVD</abbr>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herself: The <abbr>TV</abbr> doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Myself: I unplugged it.</p>
<p>Her: When?</p>
<p>Me: About six months ago.</p>
<p>Her: Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Me: To prove we never use it.</p>
<p>Her: I&#8217;m trying to use it right now.</p>
<p>Me: What are you hoping to accomplish?</p>
<p>Her: I need to calm the boys down.</p>
<p>Me: And this need has not arisen in the past six months?</p>
<p>Her: We usually read books.</p>
<p>Me: Why can&#8217;t we do that now?</p>
<p>Her: &#8230;</p>
<p>Me: Can we get rid of the television now?</p>
<p>Her: No, we might need it.</p>
<p>Me: OK, but I&#8217;m not plugging it back in.</p>
<p>Her: I hate you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About five and a half months after that, which is to say about two weeks ago, I had <a href="/web/20110514112135/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/10/17/buying-art-online">bought some new art</a> and set about rearranging the walls to make everything fit. &#8220;Aha, an opportunity presents itself!&#8221; I thought to myself. You see, the (unplugged) television had always blocked a critical piece of real estate in our bedroom, above the dresser, in direct line of sight while lying in bed. The next morning, shortly after she had left the house to go to work, I disassembled the whole contraption, television and <abbr>DVD</abbr> player and all. I cleaned up an impressive amount of Assorted Random Crap that had accumulated around, behind, and beneath the television, I said goodbye to the final pile of physical discs in our house, and I hung one of my wife&#8217;s favorite pieces on the newly reclaimed wall in its place. When she came home, I gave her the grand tour of our newly rearranged walls, of course working up to the bedroom as the finale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herself: Yes! You finally got rid of that stupid television!</p>
<p>Myself: You know I unplugged it a year ago.</p>
<p>Her: Really? Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Me: It&#8217;s not important.</p>

<li id="comment-13823"><p>Clay, are you sure that&#8217;s chauvinistic? The millionaire is male, and I know nothing of the financial situation of his wife. In what way would it be chauvinistic to expect someone to consult their partner, of whatever sex, before making a major lifestyle change which will inevitably affect them both in some way?

<li id="comment-13826"><p>@Clay Bridges: Chauvinistic assumptions? There is a link in the sentence. It is about a specific person, a man. The parenthesized sentence is about the choice of using &#8220;millionaires who decide to give away all their money&#8221; instead of &#8220;the millionaire who decided to give away all his money&#8221;. This much is obvious. Are you suggesting that one use (singular, awkward) &#8220;their&#8221; instead of &#8220;his&#8221;, even when the gender is clear?</p>

<li class=me id="comment-13827"><p>To be fair to Clay, I read the article, specifically this sentence: &#8220;Mr Rabeder has also sold the interior furnishings and accessories business – from vases to artificial flowers – that made his fortune.&#8221; And I assumed that he either made the money before he met his wife, or he ran the business by himself. Neither is stated in the article; it&#8217;s perfectly plausible that he and his wife ran the business, and thus made the money, together.</p>
<p>Still, you don&#8217;t sell a multi-million dollar villa in the Alps and move into a small wooden hut unless your wife agrees with your newfound definition of happiness. Which was my point &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to simplify when your choices directly affect other people who don&#8217;t share your zeal for simplifying.</p>

<li id="comment-13828"><p>Nearly the same discussions in our house. I dread the work that will be required if we ever move.</p>
<p>Also: going without the car is tough. When getting on the train, you&#8217;ve now got a bike, plus backpack, and maybe also a secondary pack. That &#8212; plus winter gloves, hat, &amp; scarf &#8212; is a lot to contend with. Especially when the train is packed. Even with a folding bike it&#8217;s quite tough. And if it&#8217;s cold and raining? Yow &#8212; you need a full rainsuit, and then you&#8217;re dripping when getting on the train.</p>

<li id="comment-13842"><p>Mark, it was like you were speaking directly to me. I love the idea of getting rid of stuff and simplifying, but you hit the nail on the head; once your simplifying affects others who don&#8217;t care for it i.e. my girlfriend, the whole thing gets much harder. Same with receiving gifts from friends and family. It is nice to know that other people are in the same situation. And judging by the other comments it seems we&#8217;re all in good company. Thanks for the inspiration :D</p>

<li id="comment-13846"><p>The reason you&#8217;re doing all this stuff is because your wife isn&#8217;t hot enough.  When a guy is stuck with an unattractive mate, he goes neurotic looking for ways to be happy which won&#8217;t actually work.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never gone out with a really attractive girl then you won&#8217;t have a reference for this.  It&#8217;s just something wired into male brains which will surprise you if you&#8217;ve never experienced it.</p>
<p>If you HAVE experienced it then you may have forgotten.  Nothing else works as well as doing fun things (including vacations, events, concerts, etc.) with a very attractive partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Love&#8221; for males is really just sexual attraction.  It&#8217;s THE vital component, no more optional than water or air for quality of life.</p>
<p>Of course social pressure makes it &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; to begin romancing a younger girl since you&#8217;re married with kids.  So the easy way out is to do minor things that really make no difference, because you let others&#8217; opinions stop you from doing what would actually work.  &#8220;Change is hard &#8212; let&#8217;s die inside a little more every day!&#8221;</p>
<p>Think it would be &#8220;selfish&#8221;?  Getting rid of all your stuff (re: your FAMILY&#8217;S stuff) is ALSO selfish.  You&#8217;re getting rid of tools that OTHERS could find useful because YOU are at a certain stage.  If you were really unattached then it wouldn&#8217;t make any difference whether something was there or not.  You&#8217;re just making it more likely that one of these days, your wife is going to BUY a new TV/DVD player just because she happens to want one at the time and feels it&#8217;s ridiculous you got rid of perfectly usable commonplace items.</p>
<p>Getting rid of stuff doesn&#8217;t fix anything.  It&#8217;s just a symptom of realizing that the stuff isn&#8217;t what makes you happy.  But getting rid of what you don&#8217;t need ISN&#8217;T the same as getting what you DO need.  Lack of junk != Presence of people.</p>
