<a href="/web/20110806085602/http://diveintomark.org/archives#p1324">April 21, 2003</a> &#8227;
<h2>What&#8217;s your Winer Number?</h2> (<a href="/web/20110806085602/http://diveintomark.org/tag/winernumber" rel="tag">winernumber</a>)</div>
<p>Paul Erd&ouml;s was a prolific mathematician who co-authored papers with hundreds of people.  The <a href="/web/20110806085602/http://www.oakland.edu/~grossman/readme.html">Erd&ouml;s Number</a> is part of mathematics folklore; it measures the <q>six degrees of separation</q> distance between you and Paul, using co-authorship as the measurement.</p>

<p>In this spirit, and in recognition of the fact that Dave Winer is the center of the weblogging universe, I propose a new designation: <strong>The Winer Number</strong>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how you can determine your Winer Number:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dave Winer has Winer Number 0.</li>
<li>If you have been personally abused by Dave Winer, your Winer Number is 1.</li>
<li>If you have been abused by someone who has been abused by Dave Winer, your Winer Number is 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the purposes of this designation, <q>personally abused</q> means an <span lang="la">ad hominem</span> attack directed at a single person:</p>

<ul>
<li>in private email, where you are the only person in the <samp>To:</samp> line</li>

<p>Since so many people have been personally abused by Dave over the years, the <strong>Extended Winer Number</strong> was created to distinguish between them.  If you have been personally abused by Dave, your Extended Winer Number is 1 / (the number of times abused).</p>

<p>It is stipulated as an axiom that Bill Kearney has the lowest possible non-zero Extended Winer Number.</p>

<p>So remember, kids: the next time Dave Winer abuses you, just calmly respond, <q>All you&#8217;re doing is lowering my Winer Number</q> and move on.</p>

<p>i have a winer of 1/1, for having the unmitigated call of explaining to a newbie the benefits of css on a message board.</p>

<li id="comment-1697"><p>If Dave answered all of the emails about his cruddy software, everyone&#8217;s EWN would be lower. Of course, he doesn&#8217;t respond &#8211; nor does anyone &#8211; thus keeping everyone&#8217;s EWN fairly high. That having been said, I&#8217;m a 1/4. Pity&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, what if you&#8217;ve been abused by Dave&#8217;s software? Does that give you a WN of about 4?</p>

<li id="comment-1698"><p>I think you will find that abuse does not fully connect blogdom.  Most people will have a Winer number &lt;= 1 or an undefined Winer number.</p>
<p>To add some meaning to this otherwise meaningless thread, I will mention that the book &#8220;Six Degrees: The science of the connected age&#8221; by Duncan Watts covers the Erdos number and other fascinating topics.</p>

<li id="comment-1703"><p>So I finally figure out what the fuss is all about after taking a BellSouth imposed break from even reading blogs, and I finally understand all this stuff, after reading Sam&#8217;s blog. I actually built a feed editor for my RSS reader after our last lunch, just so I could delete Dave&#8217;s feed. And now I find out I have to taunt you until you abuse me so my Weiner number will become lower. Geez, take some time off and everybody pisses everyone else off.</p>

<li id="comment-1705"><p>I don&#8217;t understand why Bill gets the lowest possible number. A number of people I know &#8212; myself included, actually &#8212; would suggest that Bill Kearney, David Bayly and myself all deserve exactly the same rating. That is, our EWN is so close to zero that HE may sometimes confuse us for himself.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I&#8217;ve very often been on the opposite end of the spectrum with Dave, meaning he has posted high praise of me or my work&#8230; usually just days before the next round of abuse starts. (or even during the same abuse)</p>

<p>Unfortunately (for Zeldman), Zeldman seems to be laboring under the misapprehension that, if he says enough nice things up front before disagreeing with Dave, he can get Dave to go easy on him, or reconsider his position, or even listen to what he has to say.  I used to fall into the same trap.  It seems like a good strategy (&#8220;butter &#8216;em up before dropping the bomb&#8221; &#8212; it certainly works with lots of people, including me), but it doesn&#8217;t work with Dave.</p>

<li id="comment-1718"><p>Yeah, Zeldman did a fair bit of buttering, before the disagreeing part.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious, are you only assuming (from experience?) that this particular buttering would not have worked on Dave, or was there some private correspondance between yourself, Zeldman, and Dave that supports that claim?</p>

<li class=me id="comment-1720"><p>Mar: I base my statement on repeated observation of people on mailing lists trying to give constructive criticism of specs/APIs/formats that Dave favors, people on discussion forums trying to report bugs in UserLand products (Dave&#8217;s previous job), and also personal experience in private email.</p>
<p>As to why I bother, regular readers will notice that I stopped bothering sometime last year, after the last CSS debate.  Many communities have powerful people who act up in various ways, and learning how to handle them is a useful and unfortunately necessary skill.</p>
<p>I learned this skill well by engaging him in debate last year.  I made all the mistakes then that others are making now (including Zeldman).  Note that I have *not* tried to engage him in any meaningful debate this round, because there is no point.  I have not repeated the mistakes I made last year, trying to argue with him directly or thinking I could convince him to change his ways.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I try to focus on making positive contributions.  Admittedly, some days this works better than others.  I try to lead by example, I write tutorials, I go through public redesigns and explain myself along the way, and so forth.  I learn from people who teach, and I teach people who want to learn.  Dave wants to do neither, so I (and, eventually, the rest of the community) will simply leave him behind.</p>
<p>But yeah, sometimes I can&#8217;t help but tweak him, and others, who so sorely deserve it.  I sorely deserve it sometimes too, and people who know me know how to tweak me.  It&#8217;s a perverse form of flattery, I suppose.</p>

<li id="comment-1725"><p>Definitely a Winer number of 1:</p>
<p>Ages ago, when people thought it would be a cute idea to have little &#8220;banners&#8221; posted on Weblogs.com as &#8220;ads&#8221; for their weblogs, Dave screwed up the permissions on the images directory that held the banners. This would&#8217;ve been ok, except each file was named with the email address of its owner, .jpg. </p>
<p>I found out about it because I signed up as &#8216;thatsite@mysite.com&#8217;. A few weeks  later, I started getting spam. Emails to the Weblogs.com admins were ignored. I posted some questions to MeFi, and found out that I wasn&#8217;t the only one getting spammed. Even better, Dave had been notified of the vulnerability for over four months, and never fixed the problem.</p>

<li id="comment-1726"><p>Unfortunately (for Zeldman), Zeldman seems to be laboring under the misapprehension that, if he says enough nice things up front before disagreeing with Dave, he can get Dave to go easy on him, or reconsider his position, or even listen to what he has to say.</p>
<p>Mark: I was writing for my readers, not for Dave. (If I&#8217;d wanted to contact Dave I would have emailed him.) I wrote in hopes of minimizing some of  the damage caused by Dave&#8217;s anti-CSS remarks, which seem to be based only on the most cursory experience with the spec, i.e. trying something for a few minutes and then giving up when it doesn&#8217;t work the way he thinks it should. </p>
<p>I began with a summary of Dave Winer&#8217;s history as a publisher and developer of XML-based specs because that is where the contradiction lies. Dave is not a novice relieving his frustration in a little-read corner of the web. He is a widely read web publisher who has helped create several XML-based standards, which makes his disdain for other standards all the more baffling. </p>
<p>I hoped to avoid turning this issue into a personal one. Personal attacks, even if they retaliatory, and even when they are amusing, merely escalate the name calling. More importantly, they obscure the IDEA that was orginally being discussed: semantic markup and CSS versus tag soup. That idea is now gone; instead we have name calling on one side, and personality-driven satire on the other. None of that will help developers who&#8217;ve had a few less than salutary experiences with CSS and structural markup and wonder whether they should persevere or give up and stick with the tag soup they know.</p>
<p>Those fence sitters are the people who matter in this discussion, and they are not being served by the Ego Tennis match this has turned into.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-1729"><p>Zeldman, I too am puzzled by Dave&#8217;s dual nature with standards generally, which was the purpose of my &#8220;Enough already&#8221; post.  Explained more fully here:</p>
<p><a href="/web/20110806085602/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/18/enough_already.html#c001370">http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/18/enough_already.html#c001370</a></p>
<p>However, I am not puzzled by Dave&#8217;s hatred of CSS.  More on that in a minute.</p>
<p>But first, re: &#8220;I hoped to avoid turning this issue into a personal one.&#8221;  What you fail to realize (and I can only assume this is due to lack of experience dealing with Dave) is that *everything* with Dave is personal.  Bug reports will get you cursed at, suggestions for enhancements will get you called an idiot, questioning his understanding of a problem or his proposed solution makes you an asshole.  Furthermore, everything he doesn&#8217;t understand is eventually construed as a conspiracy against his products, and therefore against him.  </p>
<p>Example: you have a style switcher.  Last year I had a similar switcher, with a few different crudely built CSS &#8220;themes&#8221;.  Visitors could select one from a dropbox, and the theme would stick through subsequent page hits and visits.</p>
<p>At the time, I held this up as a concrete example of the benefits of CSS.  Dave&#8217;s response was that his Manila weblogging product already had themes.  Which is sort of true, in the sense that there is a mechanism for a site author to easily import and install a bundle of graphics + templates.  (All pages are dynamic, so the changes are available immediately.  I used to have a Manila-based weblog, and it&#8217;s a powerful feature.)  However, I mentioned that my solution allowed *multiple* templates, and that it allowed the *end user* to choose between them, instead of the site author.  He replied that Frontier (on which Manila is based) could do that, which, as far as I know, is also true.</p>
<p>In other words, Dave sees CSS&#8217;s main benefit (separation of markup and styling) as a threat to his CMS products, each of which have ways of managing the separation of content and markup.  Note that there is actually no threat here &#8212; they serve different purposes and are in fact complementary technologies &#8212; but Dave insists on conflating separation-of-markup-and-styling with separation-of-content-and-markup, and therefore mistakenly thinks that he has already solved the problems CSS is trying to solve.</p>
<p>To further drive home this point, it should be pointed out that Frontier&#8217;s (and Manila&#8217;s, and Radio&#8217;s) idea of a &#8220;template&#8221; is a single string + associated graphics files.  To this day, no UserLand CMS product has the ability to manage external stylesheets as part of a &#8220;template&#8221;.  All of Radio&#8217;s (and Manila&#8217;s) CSS-based themes use inline CSS in the [style] element of each page, thus precluding all CSS import hiding tricks and negating the bandwidth-saving benefits of CSS.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s where the loop closes and it all becomes clear: any attempt to suggest that CSS really ought to be stored in a separate file is viewed as an attack on his products (which don&#8217;t do that), and therefore as an attack on Dave personally.</p>
<p>As for convincing fence-sitters, they will be swayed by examples of specific solutions that show that this stuff is easier than they thought, not harder. The specific problem Dave was having had already been solved by the time you posted; why didn&#8217;t you simply point to that instead?</p>

<p>(As you can see from the associated comments thread, Bryan Bell originally made the templates in question *for free*, and later suggested the correct solution to Dave&#8217;s &#8220;CSS problem&#8221; (really an invalid HTML problem) *for free*, and he was immediately abused *anyway*.)</p>

<li id="comment-1732"><p>The average reader I think will be surprised, since Dave (since the last battle) appeared to at least warm up to CSS, or stop bashing it. Plus all the efforts by Bryan Bell to bring CSS to the Radio and Manilla masses, and the adoption of CSS based templates by users, gave CSS some legitimacy in &#8220;user-land&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, it was surprising to see him rant so.</p>

<p>He responded with general whining about being tired of all the &#8220;personal attacks&#8221;, why are so many people trying to denigrate his product, blah blah blah. All I was saying was that I couldn&#8217;t figure his program out.</p>
<p>Well, John Robb contacted me later and explained that, in order to get Radio working, you had to first stop using Radio. That&#8217;s right, he said to get out of the GUI environment that it spawned (with no instructions) and instead connect to a specific port on my local box via a browser.</p>

<p>One fine day, google took over blogger and then onwards you got to read, why we should be afraid of google posts on davenet.</p>
<p>all very amusing :-)</p>

<li id="comment-1743"><p>Winered.<br />
Hmnn, I fot Winered today. Dave pointed out <a href="/web/20110806085602/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/crimson1/2003/04/24#a99">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/crimson1/2003/04/24#a99</a> in his blog to highlight that he had a theory as to why users want open source.</p>
<p>After 22 comments, he turned off comments. Leave it to your imagination. I suspect this was done as a result of my last set of comments pointing out that Product Manager arrogance or lack of skill are fatal issues for a company, or an open source project.</p>
<p>Rather than telling us to &#8220;stick our hands under our ass and think&#8221; Dave, the unarrogant approach is to engage those who have put effort into communicating ideas. Otherwise, why ask?</p>
<p>People vote either with their wallets or with their time.</p>

<li id="comment-1745"><p>Mike: I got Winered on that same thread today. In may case, I had just crafted a response to the &#8220;PYTHON is a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, for crying out loud&#8221; rant when I hit submit and lost it all because comments were gone :)</p>
<p>Whee.</p>
<p>I guess we can share the lowering of our Winer numbers, since it wasn&#8217;t clear whether his &#8220;for crying out loud&#8221; was directed at you or me for our Python anecdotes.</p>

<li id="comment-1750"><p>My Winer Number is probably negative, because while he flamed me in a short-lived comment last year, I&#8217;ve criticized his behavior more often than he&#8217;s criticized mine.</p>
<p>However, before this discussion closes I should point out that since Mark wrote comment 46 above, support for external style sheets *has* been introduced into Manila. It was always *technically* possible, by linking to a style sheet kept in your &#8220;Gems&#8221; folder, but Manila now makes it practical by providing you with a form specifically to edit such a Gem (rather than having to delete it, upload a new one, and change the link every time). I don&#8217;t know how much that change is attributable to (1) Mark&#8217;s comment itself, (2) a request from Bryan Bell, or (3) unignorable requests from new Manila users at Harvard.</p>
