<li id="comment-13318"><p>So now that XHTML is passé, and since HTML5 won’t be ready until 2052, I’m going back to HTML 4.01.  Did you know SGML DTDs can use a shortcut to close tags by using a slash and *not a greater-than*, i.e., `&lt;br/`? (That was not a typo.)  And did you know that HTML 4.01 Strict DTD employs said shortcut? So &#8220; in HTML4 has an extra `&gt;` and is therefore *wrong*, even though no browser actually implements that syntax (don’t believe me? go try the validator!).  In other words, goodbye slashes.  It was good to know you.</p>

So just take it on faith (you can trust me, you&#8217;ve gOt IP for feck&#8217;s sake) that you would be sufficiently cowed that you would apologize to Jeffrey for causing or possibly causing offense to one who has done more for the web than, I suspect, you will ever do.</p>

<li id="comment-13331"><p>I&#8217;ve been buying the &#8216;xhtml is pointless&#8217; argument for some time now.  But I do think that Zeldman&#8217;s work in inspiring a more code-conscious attitude among developers through the standards movement has been a big net win for producers and consumers of web content.  So this seems a little harsh.  </p>
<p>Then again, everything has its context, and within the context of actually trying to define and propagate new standards, the misinformation around XHTML that has come out of his movement is open to real criticism, I suppose.  And this was fun.  Your overall tone suggests thick skin, so I guess you don&#8217;t mind the blog karma.  I enjoy your writing.</p>
<p>Really, I&#8217;m just glad that I can come here at work now and not have to worry about big bold &#8220;fuck the foundries&#8221; on my screen.</p>

<li id="comment-13333"><p>What some observers may fail to account for is that Jeffrey is the person who made markup *relevant* to the world at large. Markup, HTML, and the W3C itself. And Hixie, you Marc, and most of us commenting here. As confused as he may or may not be, he deserves some respect. I&#8217;m not sure how this post helps clarifying the overall confusion.</p>

<li id="comment-13334"><p>@KT: Emphasis on «joke».  If I was Jeffrey I wouldn’t be offended at all.  My friends joke about stuff I do all the time, and whether it’s deserving or not, no one cares.  That’s what humor is supposed to be for.  I truly don’t get what all the rage is about.  It’s, in my opinion, the kind of exaggerated reaction that people only allow themselves to indulge in the net, without the social effects of human interaction and body language, where you can flame other people and not feel guilty.  Every time this happens, I get more depressed about what the future of communication is — i.e. one where people aren’t allowed to joke without being metaphorically stoned.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-13336"><p>Zeldman could have taken this opportunity to say, &#8220;Good news! After many years in the wilderness, the W3C has finally heard the concerns that I and others have been voicing about the needs of real web developers and designers. They have pulled the plug on the fantasy called &#8216;XHTML 2&#8242; that wasn&#8217;t backwardly compatible with the markup you&#8217;ve been writing for the past 10 years, wasn&#8217;t being implemented by any major browsers, and would have required a whole new world of pain known as &#8216;draconian error handling.&#8217; And don&#8217;t worry, you can still close your tags and quote your attributes and validate your pages as HTML 5, if that&#8217;s the coding style you&#8217;re comfortable with.&#8221;</p>

HTML 5 have taken a lot of important but undocumented underpinnings of the web platform &#8212; essentials like document.write, XMLHttpRequest, even the Window object &#8212; reverse-engineered all the major browsers (especially Internet Explorer), and documented how they actually work. Browser vendors are already fixing some of their parsing quirks, filling in gaps in their implementations of previously undocumented/underdocumented features, and converging on more interoperable behavior. You won&#8217;t see the results overnight, but these are important steps towards making the web a less frustrating development platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeldman could have taken this opportunity to say, &#8220;And hey, it&#8217;s not just about documenting the old crap. The standards-based web is gaining new features at a faster rate than any time in history. Things like video, audio, canvas, threaded Javascript, offline functionality, and other stuff that many of you have been asking for for over a decade&#8230; they&#8217;re coming, and some of them are already here. I&#8217;ll be using my many platforms &#8212; here on my blog, on &#8216;A List Apart&#8217;, and in future books &#8212; to explain to all of you how you can build next-generation web sites based on web standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t. He said, &#8220;WTF happened to the &#8216;X&#8217;?&#8221; and proceeded to play the faux populist and martyr.</p>

<p>Are you referring to the post title &#8220;XHTML DOA WTF&#8221;?  It&#8217;s it obvious from the opening paragraph and the his comments that this was meant ironically?</p>

<li id="comment-13341"><p>No, Zeldman did not say &#8220;WTF happened to the &#8216;X&#8217;?&#8221;. The headline to his post reporting the news of the end of XHTML 2 was &#8220;XHTML DOA WTF&#8221;, which I imagine is kind of a joke you&#8217;re choosing not to get. He really offered no further comment than just reporting the news, besides acknowledging that it would provoke some debate. Just to be clear, so you might understand, the WTF bit is, most likely, a reference to the confusion caused by the demise of XHTML 2, given that web standards evangelists have been saying for ten years that XHTML was the future. That&#8217;s all. But you knew that, you just went for a cheap shot that doesn&#8217;t make sense, and makes you look much smaller than you are.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-13343"><p>No, the &#8220;faux populist and martyr&#8221; is a reference to this quote from Zeldman&#8217;s followup post: &#8220;there are just as many people who worry that a specification of which they don&#8217;t entirely approve is being shoved down their throats by an uncaring elite.&#8221; Puuuuuuhleeeeeeeeze. (And never mind his perpetuating the zombie lies about &#8220;2022&#8243; and &#8220;a toddler specification.&#8221; It&#8217;s been actively developed for over 5 years, and browsers are already shipping support for large parts of it. Frankly, I&#8217;d think twice about hiring a designer who&#8217;s so wrapped up in his own little world that he doesn&#8217;t even know about the major new features in Safari 4 and Firefox 3.5.)</p>
<p>@Eric: boy, I thought Henri&#8217;s bit about &#8220;something newer and shinier&#8221; was a little harsh, but it turns out he really nailed it. The minute it became clear that XHTML was no longer the newest and shiniest, you people just went right off the rails.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: XHTML 1 was a stepping stone to nowhere. You people found a nice little loophole where you could claim you were using the latest and greatest (without having to deal with all that icky draconian error handling), and you milked it for all it was worth. But XHTML 1 was always a deadend; there was never any future there. It had to end sometime. You did know that, right?</p>

<li id="comment-13344"><p>What the hell are you talking about, Mark?  Seriously.  Because at a minimum, the following terms need some clarification for me: &#8220;you people&#8221; and &#8220;right off the rails&#8221;.  Which people, and what rails?</p>
<p>And please, by all means, point out to me where I milked XHTML for anything at all.  Because as I recall, I said more than once that I didn&#8217;t care what language people used as long as they used it correctly; that I personally preferred HTML to XHTML; and that my blog was all HTML4 for a while and then became a mixture of XHTML and HTML, depending on what was generating or had generated the page.  <a href="/web/20110806090005/http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003/01/14/agony-and-ivory/">Like here, for example</a>.  <a href="/web/20110806090005/http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003/11/19/lather-rinse-repeat/">Or here</a>.  <a href="/web/20110806090005/http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2005/09/25/slashdots-validity/">Or here</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, none of that means I think that people who pushed for and promoted XHTML were wrong to do so, or that they were milking anything.  I think&#8211; actually, I <em>know</em>&#8211; they did so for the best of reasons, in good faith, in an attempt to promote the best authoring practices they knew in order to build the best web they could.  No exploits, no hunting for loopholes, no ill intent.  No malice at all, despite what some will claim.</p>
<p>Someone&#8217;s going off the rails, all right, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s who you think it is.  What I still fail to understand is why.</p>

<li id="comment-13345"><p>I don&#8217;t get what you&#8217;re so upset about. Zeldman promoted a markup language that was useful and worked. It&#8217;s allowed me to build hundreds of sites over the past five or so years that look consistent across browsers and are easy to maintain. Sorry if it wasn&#8217;t what you would have used, or if some extra slashes took up any of your internet. Maybe people like me aren&#8217;t really the target of your ire, since I don&#8217;t really care what I&#8217;m using over the next five years as long as it continues to look consistent across browsers and is easy to maintain.</p>

The intellectual masturbation is a predictable result of all standards efforts that try to invent new technology as opposed to codifying and standardizing existing practice (ISO/OSI anyone?). Design by committee leads nowhere, and standards committees are worse than most. I am worried that HTML5 will follow the same path with everyone and their grandmother clamoring for their pet useless feature (e.g. RDFa) to be included.

It’s, in my opinion, the kind of exaggerated reaction that people only allow themselves to indulge in the net, without the social effects of human interaction and body language, where you can flame other people and not feel guilty.

<p>I don&#8217;t understand why someone would mock XHTML or HTML 5 used with XHTML syntax or XHTML served as text/html.</p>
<p>Nor would I understand why some may pretend that writing HTML 4.01 or HTML 5 (with HTML syntax) can be in any way superior to writing XHTML 1.0 or HTML 5 (with XHTML syntax) or XHTML 5 (served as application/xml+xhtml).</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents&#8230;</p>

<li id="comment-13367"><p>Why all the snark and verbal violence flying around in this so-called debate? &#8220;XHTML Taliban?&#8221; Oh. Please. What exactly is there to debate, anyway? XHTML was a tool a lot of people, myself included, find more suited to their particular needs. In fact there are quite a few things I found more difficult or impossible to do with HTML4 due to its goofy, inconsistent DOM implementation across browsers; in my &#8220;real world&#8221; what I care about is that XHTML requires me to do less work for the same result for the things that I do, and I like the way the code looks much better. This is something that may not be clear to a designer who only cares about the presentational outcome (and typically does not write the markup anyway, which leads me to wonder why they would care), but as a developer who does a hell of a lot more work with PHP &amp; Javascript than with the markup, XHTML makes a big difference for me. Clearly even the people working on XHTML 2 came do admit that it was not going to be carrying that torch. </p>
<p>Nobody &#8220;wins&#8221; or &#8220;loses&#8221; anything when a tentative spec that nobody gives a damn about gets cancelled. As far as I can tell there&#8217;s nothing to gloat or pout about here.</p>

<p>&#8220;XHTML&#8221; served as text/html <strong>is</strong> HTML, with <em>exactly the same</em> &#8220;goofy, inconsistent DOM implementation across browsers.&#8221; The fact that you thought you were getting different behaviour, by serving &#8220;XHTML&#8221; as text/html is <strong>exactly</strong> the sort of magical thinking that Mark was complaining about.</p>

<li id="comment-13375"><p>Very sad to read &#8220;diveintomark&#8221; and &#8220;zeldman&#8221; and so many others to fight in pointless war&#8230;</p>
<p>Zeldman did a lot of great works to explain the value of a standard web.  It helps me to be aware of great tools and to explain concepts to students and co-workers.</p>
<p>Xhtml was very useful, making me possible and easy to use xml processing stuff (in plain english : to use others tools from my engineering work to create web content)  , no I was not alone.</p>
<p>Html 5 is not killing xml, so why are you fighting ?</p>
<p>Xhtml 2 is dead, okay, great, I don&#8217;t care !  Xml strict syntax is still possible.</p>
<p>-<br />
ie 6,7, 8 whatever are plain wrong to not support xml processing for website. Okay we live in the real world, believe me I&#8217;m aware. Nevertheless it was interesting to converge toward one language with strict (but optional) syntax. Believe me, it helps to ease works.</p>
<p>but okay, okay, don&#8217;t be angry, we will do html 5, it&#8217;s nice, efficient, with exciting features, we understand that.</p>
<p>But please, stop mocking people like Zeldman, he did not tell anything that harsh, did try to explain a better web and succeeds in that in part and you should be happy for that.</p>
<p>-<br />
In fact, all that story is now sickening me.  Because of that &#8216;xhtml 2&#8242; mess (a tempest in a tea cup) , now too much people are mocking others.</p>
<p>Enough ! go get to work !  hTML 5 is far to be all standard and ready in real browsers ! and I NEED reality to make money !</p>
<p>-<br />
the song and joke was nice and funny, true,  but I&#8217;m disappointed by too much person now.</p>

<li id="comment-13376"><p>&#8220;the needs of real web developers and designers&#8221;<br />
That phrase is priceless. I like XHTML problem is we are not that complicated and<br />
neither is our information. XHTML meets a application that most web designers and developers don&#8217;t understand. &#8220;That&#8217;s OK&#8221; (Stewart Smally) because the need of our information push is simple. Even if <i>we think</i> our information is smart and complicated. Isn&#8217;t a lot of the crap designers want just an advanced Marquee tag?

<p>Querks mode sucks the bat. </p>
<p>Getting over to standards mode sucks for any developer, but its just like learning to ride a bicycle.
