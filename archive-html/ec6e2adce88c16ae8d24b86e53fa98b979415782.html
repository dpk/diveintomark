<p>My Windows XP installation has reached its half-life.  (You <em>do</em> know that Windows has a half-life, don&#8217;t you?  Every installation of Windows naturally degrades along a logarithmic curve until it becomes annoying, then unbearable, then unusable.  Each successive revision of Windows has featured a slightly longer half-life.  Back in the day, Windows 95 would last me about 3 months, while my copy of Windows XP has lasted me almost 9.  I&#8217;m not bitter; when you realize that you&#8217;re measuring on a logarithmic scale, a factor of 3 improvement is really quite impressive.)</p>

<p>Still, the fact remains that my Windows XP laptop can no longer (a) print, (b) sleep, or (c) change network settings without crashing.  This is not multiple choice; it can&#8217;t do <em>any</em> of those things.  It&#8217;s time for a clean re-install.</p>

<li>Find a utility on a cracker web page in Russia that displays the current product key.  This is one of the more lame utilities, since most of the good ones allow you to change it.

<li>&#8220;Welcome to Windows XP.  You have no useful programs and no internet access.  You have 30 days left for activation.  Would you like to activate now?&#8221;  Yes, I would, but I have no internet access.</li>

<li>Search the &#8220;Network and Internet Connections&#8221; wizards in vain for some way to set up my Linksys wireless card.

Silly rabbit.</li>
<li>Search my house for my Linksys wireless card driver install disc.  Find the install disc that came with the old card, that broke and was replaced by the new-and-improved version 3.0 card.  Wonder if that will suffice.</li>
<li>Fight with the &#8220;Add New Hardware Wizard&#8221; trying to install the obviously inferior drivers off this disc.</li>
<li>Wonder where the &#8220;Device Manager&#8221; is hiding.</li>
<li>Find the &#8220;Device Manager&#8221;.  Right-click on the unknown device,  &#8220;Linksys_Instant_Wireless_Card&#8221;.

I know that&#8217;s probably not a nice thing to admit and I honestly intended to read it all, but once I realized the steps went on and on, my natural fear of all things Microsoft kicked in. I&#8217;m still using Win98 just because I don&#8217;t want to go through any of those steps.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running the same copy of XP since about a month before it was released (people actually pay for software ;) screw product activation) and its still working as well as it ever did. Maybe I&#8217;m just a bit too gentle with it but I&#8217;d hate to have to go through what you went through so I don&#8217;t really push it to its limit I suppose.</p>

<li id="comment-3962"><p>I&#8217;ve been running Windows XP for a good year or two now (since around its release date) and have still not had any problems. I think you probably have so many problems because of the hackery you do to it straight after the install. Ok, things like MSN Explorer are a nuisance, but if you are going to completely rework how you use it with things like cygwin, apache, etc. when Windows is more than capable of doing the job *if you would give it the chance*, then you are bound to run into problems.</p>
<p>For the record, I use Windows XP and various Unix distributions. Each has their place &#8211; and Windows XP is used for Windows XP tasks, and it works fine without any crashes or even any problems. In many respects, it does its job better than *nix does.</p>

<li id="comment-3964"><p>Just a quick note.. I don&#8217;t particularly like windows but have to say that Win XP Pro is the best incarnation yet. Installed and running since July last year and still stable. Only had 2 blue screens and only reboot once every two or three weeks. As for running it hard, it&#8217;s got PHP, Python, Java, Zend IDE, Wing IDE, JEdit, Perl IDE, Cygwin (Full Install.. does anyone else get tired of clicking) Apache 1.3.26, MySQL, Postgres (Win32), Postgres (Cygwin), Adobe Web Pro package, Macromedia Studio Package, VMWare (essential), Office XP, svn, Tortoise(svn,cvs), various explorer plugins (folder size, etc), moz, firebird, nn4.8, nn7, Opera5,6, vnc, efax, pgadmin, mysqladmin, mycc, xmlspy, snagit, htmlvalidator, feeddemon betas (and various other betas).. blah, blah, etc. The only problems I have now and again are the system locking up when I run out of memory. If this happenes I get the cursor back about once every minute for a couple of seconds. Typically I can either let it work out what it wants to do (can take a few hours) or try to shut things in my little control window. I don&#8217;t install win updates until they&#8217;ve been out for a month. I&#8217;ve got normal RAM (tried ECC, made no discernable) difference. Don&#8217;t defrag very often. 1Gb RAM. P4 1.4ishGHz. Can&#8217;t think why it&#8217;s so stable, possibly because I don&#8217;t reboot it all of the time?? (it stays on constantly). I think it&#8217;s like russian roullette, unfortuately when you get the bullet it really is game over and time to reinstall. Crossed fingers that hasn&#8217;t happened yet.</p>

<li id="comment-3965"><p>First off: Mark, you sound like you&#8217;d be much better off with Win2k. Half your list consists of turning off nuisances introduced with XP.</p>
<p>Next: Is there a specific reason why you&#8217;re using the ActiveState Python instead of using the one provided with Cygwin?</p>
<p>&lt;sarcasm&gt; &#8221; I think you probably have so many problems because of the hackery you do to it straight after the install. &#8220;.  Uh, ok.  So installing the applications you need, and uninstalling the one&#8217;s you don&#8217;t is hackery, and Windows is designed to react to said hackery by becoming unstable. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p>
<p>For the record: My own way of keeping windows stable over time is this:</p>
<p>a) Clean the junk from the registry every once in a while. There is a good tool at <a href="/web/20110806083853/http://www.jv16.org/">http://www.jv16.org/</a> &#8211; even though it recently went from free to cheap.</p>
<p>b) Don&#8217;t use Internet Explorer. If you do, run something like Spybot Search &#038; Destroy regularily.  ( <a href="/web/20110806083853/http://www.safer-networking.org/">http://www.safer-networking.org/</a> ) </p>
<p>c) When you&#8217;ve uninstalled an application, make sure that it actually uninstalls properly. Meaning: Most apps won&#8217;t actually delete the application folder, and many leave a lot of junk around in %Documents and Settings%.</p>
<p>d) Manually empty Windows&#8217; temp folders every once in a while. Both the ones in your %Documents and Settings% and in %WinDir%.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually managed to keep a Win2k install without reinstalling for three years this way. Until I nuked the box and installed QNX.</p>
<p>Exercise for masochists: Throw away, break, or otherwise render your MS Office 2000 CD unusable.  Then try to uninstall the application.</p>

<li id="comment-3967"><p>If you have two hard-drives and want to reduce your reinstallation time from 5 hours to around 20 minutes, I recommend using Norton�s Ghost software.</p>
<p>Install your copy of XP, configure it the way you want, then use Ghost to create an image-file of your entire boot-drive. (Make sure you remember to change the location of your My Documents folder to your second hard-drive before you go about this, or there will be tears, and the spilling of much blood later.)</p>
<p>Whenever XP throws a barney you can just stick in your Ghost boot-disk, reboot, and click some buttons. By the time you�ve gone away to make yourself a cup of coffee, drink it, and return � you�ll have your old, ready-configured installation of XP back again.</p>

<li id="comment-3970"><p>SWEET JESUS. FIVE HOURS!?! Give me a FreeBSD Unix install. Five minutes from start to finish. Even Mandrake Linux with it&#8217;s user friendly auto installer can be done fully in under thirty minutes. </p>
<p>If you are forced install Winblows, the best way is to create two paritions, set up everything on parition one, (Install applications and such), and then image onto the second partition. This will 1/2 the capacity of your drive although it will make restoring a full system somwhere between 30 seconds to 4 minutes, because it will reload everything from the image. This takes just as long as it takes to boot off a floppy and run the auto imager. Check out good old symantec ghost. About the only good product to ever come out of their labs.</p>

<p>I have to admit that, aside from Cygwin (putty debian.insom.me.uk), I did most of the same. I&#8217;d install 2000, but it&#8217;s just too much effort, and I&#8217;ve almost got exactly that now. Also Movie Maker 2 is pretty good for a free product.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-3978"><p>In response to various comments that I should be smarter/more automated/using less or different software:</p>
<p>This is the software I am required to use.  This is my work laptop.  It is not a choice.  My last project involved a desktop web application that ran Apache on Windows; we are still supporting it so that&#8217;s required.  That same project (and many other projects) use CVS, ssh, rsync, and other Unix tools for source control and workflow.  I use ActiveState Python because it comes with the win32api stuff built in, which we&#8217;re using, and it&#8217;s the version of Python we shipped to our clients, so I have to stay with it to test the dwindling number of support issues.  Oh, and we&#8217;re using XP at all because someone needed to be running it because we were getting reports of compatibility problems during beta testing.  I can and do run every other version of Windows in a virtual machine (VMWare rocks), but XP activation means it binds itself to a particular hardware configuration, and it seemed silly to risk binding it to a VM.</p>
<p>I do not have an extra hard drive, and extra partition, or Ghost.  I understand the concepts involved, I have done the same or similar things for years on multiple platforms.  It just wasn&#8217;t an available option this time.</p>
<p>In short, nothing I did to &#8220;set up Windows XP&#8221; was optional.  It was *not* set up after step 29.  It is not even completely set up after step 147; I just got enough installed to make sure I could run my most important work projects, and then I gave up in utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>1) Find out Netlock VPN client and Remote access desktop software are available for Mac OS X.<br />
2) Fill out Netlock form for VPN client demo and download free RDC software.<br />
3) Install Netlock and RDC flawlessly.<br />
4) Fiddle with IP numbers for about a week, not realizing I have the wrong IPs and eventually get the right ones.<br />
5) Remotely log into a Nortel Networks VPN to my business and remotely access 3 terminal servers necessary to do my job&#8230;. all from a G4 Mac and a 56k modem and with little help from IT other than getting the IP numbers.</p>
<p>This is secretly what mark is trying to tell everyone:</p>
<p>EVERYTHING&#8230; absolutely EVERYTHING about computers should be this damn easy, even across multiple platforms.  Yes its extremely hard to get software this way, but its not impossible, and installations like this prove it.  People in this work think computers just don&#8217;t work unless you poor your own blood from a major vein onto it and chant a voodoo ritual.</p>
<p>Software that works like this is crap and all companies should return it as crap.</p>
<p>No this is not an anti-MS, pro-Apple rant.  If you&#8217;ll note, RDC is a microsoft product, and it worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>In the future, why not keep a copy of Knoppix around ( <a href="/web/20110806083853/http://www.knoppix.net/">http://www.knoppix.net/</a> ) ? Knoppix is a GNU/Linux distribution that boots and runs completely from the CD. Whhile it includes several recent Linux software and desktop apps, such as OpenOffice.org, Abiword, etc &#8230; it&#8217;s also mounts your Windows file systems so you can get in there and make repairs booting from the CD &#8230; and getting around any security that encumbers you from fixing your own machine.</p>

<p>Sorry for not including this in my previous message. But points/*nix utilities 106-137 (via cygwin) &#8230; are also supported rather nicely with GNU utilities for Win32 ( <a href="/web/20110806083853/http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a> ).</p>
<p>All the command line commands that really count and then some.</p>

<li id="comment-3990"><p>I have to storngly second one of the suggestions above. Get Norton GHOST or Powerquest DRIVEIMAGE. You do the installation once and then backup an image of the drive. Then when you are ready to start again, just decompress the image to the partition. I must admit it was more precious back in the Win95 days, when reformatting and reinstalling was a frequent exercise, but it&#8217;s still good now. Note that to make an image with DRIVEIMAGE you don&#8217;t even  have to boot &#8220;DOS&#8221; (contrary to GHOST) and you can boot the DRIVEIMAGE cd to restore/reinstall your image.</p>

<li id="comment-3991"><p>I recently gone over to pure OSX at work (with Virtual PC for Windows stuff). Virtal PC lets you &#8220;undo&#8221; changes to a PC installation. Wonderful for testing. You can set up Win 95 up to XP as seperate &#8220;PCs&#8221;. Setup XP the way you want it and save the drive image. Then, test, hack away and just choose not to save changes to the PC when you shutdown. the your back to your fresh installation. This way you can activate XP and then save the image. I have 98, ME, 2000 and XP set up this way. I run a seperate 2000 Pro installation for development stuff. he only caveat is you need a fast Pro Mac (1ghz with at least 768 RAM and an L3 cache)  for it to be usuable.  Works well for me. Just thought I&#8217;d throw that out in case it might help.</p>

<li id="comment-3998"><p>If you&#8217;d like to copy that partition and don&#8217;t have Norton Ghost available, save the money, do a google search on the GPLed partimage and use it to save the partition over the net or on a second partition, even in 800M (CDROM) or 1.44k (disc ;) pieces.</p>
<p>Though the NTFS support is said to be experimental and won&#8217;t work with compressed or heavily fragmented system files, it will verbosely fail when trying to make the backup rather than fail when you&#8217;re trying to recreate the partition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great tool that works very well over here, with NTFS and anything else I&#8217;ve tried (FAT32, ext2/3fs).</p>

<li id="comment-3999"><p>LOL, that sure is erm&#8230; one way of doing it. Fortunately there&#8217;s the lucky ones (very few, no doubt) who claim the installation is finished at step 13, and that XP Pro&#8217;s &#8216;half-life&#8217; is still unknown because after using it for 2 years it shows no signs of reaching it.<br />
Of course, luck here depends very much on the hardware you run, and it also tends to improve with experience ;)</p>

<li id="comment-4000"><p>i feel your pain, but here&#8217;s something to make life a bit easier &#8211; install your WinXP/2K system once with all your needed tweaks and preferences, then create a disk image. reload said image every 6-9 months &#8211; 8 minutes of wasted time vs. 5 hours.<br />
of course you always have to re-install 3rd party software that you installed afterwards, but that&#8217;s the same either way&#8230;</p>

Rather than writing XP product key on a sticky label, and sticking it to sleeve of XP install disc (as comment 82 suggests), I highly recommend taking a Sharpie -or other permanent marker- and writing the damn thing directly on the CD itself.  </p>
<p>This way, if you can&#8217;t find the product key, you won&#8217;t need it!</p>

<li id="comment-3993"><p>Re: &#8220;Readers who feel the need to point out that the title really ought to read &#8217;5 hours or fewer&#8217; can suck my left tit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those readers would have done an inadequate analysis of your semantics and blindly applied the grammatical rule concerning discrete vs. continuous quantities. The term &#8220;hours&#8221; can be either discrete or continuous depending on the author&#8217;s intent.  It appears to me that your intent was to indicate a &#8220;duration&#8221; of 5 hours (continuous quantity) rather than specifically a &#8220;number&#8221; of 5 hours (disrete quantity), so the adjective &#8220;less&#8221; is perfectly appropriate here.</p>
<p>With respect to the nature of time as being discrete or continuous (or something else) you may be interested in a recent physics paper that could turn our accepted wisdom upside down. See: &#8220;Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity&#8221;, Peter Lynds, in the August issue of Foundations of Physics Letters. For a fascinating commentary, go to:</p>

<p>and drill down to:</p>

        Ground-breaking work in understanding of time</p>
<p>The first paragraph:</p>
<p>        A young New Zealand researcher appears to have solved Zeno&#8217;s motion paradoxes, the solution to which have puzzled some of history&#8217;s greatest scientists since their original conception almost 2500 years ago. His paper, which has highty impressed some of the world&#8217;s top physicists and been published in the August issue of Foundations of Physics Letters, also seems set to change the way that we think about time and its relationship to classical and quantum mechanics and cosmology.</p>

<li id="comment-4011"><p>Re: 84, and Microsoft-haters in general.</p>
<p>(First a few words to kami (84), I knew that you meant a lot of XP-defenders in here have had bad grammar and such and may look like idiots to people. I understand, but I want to bring this issue up here, because it&#8217;s pissing me off how people seem to think that Windows is the worst thing since what would be the opposite of sliced bread.)</p>
<p>Windows XP works very smoothly for me. It just about never gets in the way, and I find a lot of things in it helpful rather than in the way. I also just got my Office 2003 Beta CD, and Outlook 2003 runs smoother, looks better and is easier to work with.</p>
<p>Yes, Windows is not *NIX. That can mean good things too, you know.</p>
<p>Also: If Apple ships OS X with Quicktime, iTunes and iMovie, it&#8217;s obviously a quality range of products that&#8217;s good to get with the OS. If Microsoft ships XP with Windows Media Player and Windows Movie Maker (2, because 1 is indeed crap), it&#8217;s forcing people to expand their monopoly and lower competition, oh, and it just appearently happens to be the worst peice of shit to ever have shipped. Just a reflection. Funny, no? :P</p>

<li id="comment-4013"><p>It takes me about a WEEK of evenings to reinstall Windows. But that&#8217;s just all the programs I use. (Not as many as Mark!) To reinstall the core of Windows is easily done in an hour and shouldn&#8217;t cause any major problems.</p>
<p>I found Windows 98 did get clogged after a year or so requiring a fresh start. But now I&#8217;m on XP it&#8217;s much better. Half my hardware is already installed with the native drivers. Any that isn&#8217;t is very easy to set up.</p>
<p>Only 1 blue screen so far, and that was down to my graphics card unable to draw something! Even then, Windows explained the problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d advise against removing MSN Messenger, or disabling the yellow pop-up notes. Because they let you know of CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATES to Windows that come out. These can occur almost every week!</p>
<p>I was lucky to buy a magazine with Service Pack 1 on a DVD. You might be able to save a zip file of it to a CD-R. Do anything but download it!</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#8217;ve heard of equally painful problems when tackling OS-X on Zeldman.com. Just make sure you have enough hard drive space and RAM and a reasonably fast processor. Then XP lives quite happily for months to come.</p>

<li id="comment-4014"><p>Mark, I really not positive what your point is.</p>
<p>Once you eliminate steps due to human error (forgetting to record what your product ID is, neglecting to backup various config and/or drivers), and you eliminate the time on things you can&#8217;t avoid with archived OS copies (39 updates and SP1) you really end up with more like 2-3 hours if that.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you have exactly the same sort of thing if you used another OS? Same tweaking and all?</p>
<p>One kind of odd suggestion &#8211; and I&#8217;m not sure if it works but on something like the Explorer tweaking you did I&#8217;d certainly check out. Is it possible to run RegEdit and backup your registry before reinstalling the OS, then lay out your preferences after getting XP and the various OS updates and TweakUI install complete? If so, seems to me like that would eliminate about 35-40 steps right there.</p>

<p>Lemme put it this way:</p>
<p>Windows XP is stable. In fact, I even kind of like 2K more: all the stability, none of the cruft.</p>
<p>That being said, there is one reason above all I hate Microsoft. It&#8217;s not monopolization.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Windows Update.</p>
<p>Roughly, using Windows Update to fix security flaws in the OS is like trying to cover the moon with spackling paste: even if you have enough (which you don&#8217;t) meteors are constantly impacting it, creating new holes.</p>

<li id="comment-4017"><p>kami: All very good points. I totally agree with you. I think IE should be recoded from bottom to the top to be secure and stable &#8211; with their new &#8216;secure thinking&#8217; (according to themselves) it shouldn&#8217;t be that hard &#8211; and be released as an independent app.</p>
<p>One important matter is also this; *NIX is being used by maybe 10% of all the computers worldwide, tops. 8% more if we add Macs with OS X. But *NIX is much more complicated than Windows, possibly due to the fact that there are over one hundred, possibly two hundred, base apps for doing small things in the system and doing it good. This binds a web of a whole lot of apps, and it&#8217;s very hard to grasp it.</p>
<p>Windows, on the other hand, pretty much is ready to rock and roll out of the box, is built by one company with a solid one-piece (mostly) foundation and is not built with security in mind. It would take until mid-90s until the real exploits happened. The kernel was written in the 80s. Add this with atleast 70% of the world&#8217;s computer market share and you&#8217;ve got your scriptkiddie-struck platform, or meteor-struck moon if you so will.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible for Microsoft to patch all this up. They can&#8217;t. Millions of people are hacking it everyday. They&#8217;d need a totally new kernel to do it, it&#8217;d take years. As a matter of fact, only after Longhorn is finished and survives its initial few SPs and child disease-ridden minds, can Microsoft focus on creating a new kernel, which I think they will. And I also think, make no mistake, that if they recruit the right people, learn from their mistakes (they have a broad selection), and focus on security from the beginning this time, they could create a kernel that outdoes the good old *NIX kernel, more or less from the 60s.</p>
<p>I hope that it&#8217;s just a matter of time until Windows users can have a usable, nice looking AND stable and secure OS. But for now if you want that, it&#8217;s either XP with easily obtainable sharewares, or OS X or Red Hat (the nice looking and usable bits here). OS X and Red Hat (or any damn version of *NIX for that matter) would result in needing to change either the hardware or the fundamental truths� and I don&#8217;t think even 5% of today&#8217;s Windows users are willing to do that.</p>

<li id="comment-4023"><p>This is a 2 to 3 hour job, no matter how I look at it. If you know you are going to reinstall your XP once a while down the road, there are some good practice tips you can follow:</p>
<p>Create a seperate partition during install (a 1 or 2 GB partition should be OK.) Save important drivers, like you WIFI card driver, in that partition. save SP1. save anything you don&#8217;t want to bother to download there. You can even save XP CD&#8217;s 386 dir there too. Copy your important config and data there. </p>
<p>Mistakes you made there (and certainly you hould learn from it):<br />
Don&#8217;t install any XP patches until you install the latest SP. Don&#8217;t lose your key. Don&#8217;t try to get network connection before you have the good NIC driver. Don&#8217;t only think backup at the very last moment, and you need to ALWAYS backup your stuff. (What if your hard drive dies?)</p>

<li id="comment-4026"><p>Being a computing enthusiast, I have quite a bit of experience with installing the various flavors of Windows. So I have some advice&#8211;belated for Mark, unfortunately&#8211;that might help.</p>
<p>First, download any device drivers you might need. Do this before you format/reinstall/etc., especially if you need drivers for the device that will connect you to the Internet. Better still, keep a directory of drivers handy at all times. You never know when you&#8217;ll have a need for an emergency reformat. Being a build-it-yourself type, I find this saves an immense amount of time and trouble. Burn these drivers to CD and test the CD just in case. (Optional: Download the network install version of your OS&#8217;s latest service pack and include that on the CD.)</p>
<p>Next, determine ahead of time the partitioning scheme you intend to use. Some people might argue that it&#8217;s wise to have separate partitions for Windows, your applications, and your files. To tell you the truth, there&#8217;s no point in having a separate partition for applications because there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll need to reinstall the applications after reinstalling Windows. I do, however, advocate a separate partition for your files. This is especially helpful in case your system partition&#8217;s file system becomes corrupted in some way (this isn&#8217;t much of an issue with NTFS). Similarly, it&#8217;s great for holding user preferences for applications and such. For example, I keep my Outlook Express files on a separate partition, as well as my Mozilla Firebird preferences.</p>
<p>Now install Windows. Create your partitions, let the setup format the system partition, and go have a beer. You don&#8217;t need to babysit the installation for the better part of half an hour. At some point, you&#8217;re going to have to put in a few preferences (time zone, admin password, etc.) but that takes just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Once in Windows, install your device drivers. Some people will tell you to install the driver then the hardware itself. Others will tell you to install the hardware one piece at a time then install the driver for it. I say make it easy on yourself. Toss in all of the hardware even before you install. Windows 2000/XP is smart enough to not screw everything up. (This wasn&#8217;t always the case with Win9x.) Then configure your network connection.</p>
<p>After your drivers are installed, install any Windows Components you might need, such as IIS. Here&#8217;s how to find the dialog: Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Add or Remove Programs -&gt; Add/Remove Windows Components. This is dead simple (as easy as checking or unchecking a few boxes) and it doesn&#8217;t even require a reboot.</p>
<p>Now visit Windows Update. Start with the big stuff (Service Pack, .NET Framework, Windows Media Player, etc.). Download and reboot as necessary. Once the big stuff is done, go onto the bug fixes and security updates. Download and reboot as necessary.</p>
<p>Next, install your applications, games, utilities, and all that fun stuff. Install any updates for them, if applicable.</p>
<p>And finally, run the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer tool [1]. It will scan your computer for possible security vulnerabilities and make recommendations on how to lock your computer down. (Not all the recommendations are worth doing, but most are. Use your best judgement here.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me and have a lot of experience in the process, it can take you as little as an hour to go from nothing to a fully-functioning install of Windows XP. If you follow these steps, it shouldn&#8217;t take you more than a couple of hours unless you have some very large programs to install (Visual Studio .NET alone, for example, can take well over an hour).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re insane in the preparation you do for a Windows install (like me), you could even go so far as to create a slipstreamed version of Windows [2], with the latest Service Pack (among other things) built into the installation CD.</p>
<p>Painless Windows installs are all about the five Ps: Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance. If you take the time to prepare for the installation, the process will go along very smoothly and painlessly and can&#8211;for the very wierd (again, like me)&#8211;can even be an enjoyable experience. </p>

<li id="comment-4027"><p>I&#8217;m not sure what it is among WinXP users that&#8217;s causing all these stability problems.</p>
<p>I mean, some of it is undoubtedly windows.  But almost none of the XP uers I know personally (people running it for over a year with no reinstall) are having stability issues, and certainly none as serious as being unable to print or change network settings.</p>

<li id="comment-4029"><p>You know, I&#8217;m pretty sure that half-lives result in decaying *exponential* curves, not logarithmic ones. Unless you&#8217;re looking at the graph the wrong way, I guess. =)</p>
<p>Personally, I like the hide-inactive-system-tray-icons feature, usually. And a lot of those visual options that you set with TweakUI are actually settable from various places in the control panel (although they can admittedly be somewhat difficult to find). Try Display Properties -> Appearance -> Effects, and System -> Advanced -> Performance -> Settings (button).</p>
<p>Oh, and for those interested, you can have the fancy WinXP title bars without letting them be so huge. In Display Properties -> Appearance, leave the style on &#8220;Windows XP Style&#8221;, click the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; button, select &#8220;Active Title Bar&#8221;, and set the size to something reasonable like 21 or so. With the silver color scheme, I think this creates a very pleasant effect.</p>

<p>I always assumed your primary platform was MacOS X. Judging from all the *nix tools listed above, you spend a lot of time on the command line (yes, rsync rocks).</p>
<p>So do you actually _use_ windows regularly? Is it for testing? Or do you just enjoy the pure evil of it? ;-)</p>

<li id="comment-4047"><p>No joke.  Be sure to install winxp on much bigger partition than you think you need.  XP Can install on a pretty small partition if you want to seperate data from OS install, but you can&#8217;t apply updates &#8212; they use the primary partition for huge temp files.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes XP hard to backup/restore is the &#8220;My files&#8221; paradigm. It scatters your interesting files amongst windows cruft, and its very hard to move the directories to a location where you can just back up all your data and restore it.</p>

<li id="comment-4048"><p>well yo i have installed severalv versions of windows and i totally share his expieriences &#8211; see the x86 platform supports tons of hardware like windows does as well but u see with all the new hardware and the emulation of 16 bit and all this oldschool crap windows is nothing but torture compared to an os x. like posted before &#8211; you put the cd in your cd drive you press c its booting &#8211; you press install and 20 minutes later you have a working system without all this driver crap etc. the big advantage of apple is that they can optimize thier software on their hardware &#8211; compared to x86 there is way less hardware to support. so with every update of os x its getting faster cause they optimized it more &#8211; what about windows &#8211; its getiing slower and fatter and more and more unusable. i mean honestly mircosoft did not introduce any innovation since 3.11 &#8211; they were just copying &#8211; and they were doing bad. the innovations did other guys. but anyway 2 weeks ago i installled 2 pcs and i had to put xp on them, with all the updates and thousands of reboots between them it took me like 3-4 hours without installing software. i mean formatting an 80 gb hdd takes like hours &#8211; try this with any unix or os x  &#8211; it will take seconds. </p>

<li id="comment-4049"><p>Gotta admit. The only time I had to reinstall XP was when I updated the BIOS on my laptop and suddenly Standby/Hibernate and TV-Out would crash. Since the re-install It&#8217;s been going for nearly a year.<br />
As for re-installing software, I write my own so I don&#8217;t get these nasty registry thrashing problems that most people get! One copy of DevStudio and a backedup copy of my WBIn directory and I&#8217;m done :)</p>

<li id="comment-4068"><p>Ghost or some other cloning software is the way to go&#8211; if the mark makes more than $8/hour, this software will pay for itself.  No need to remind me that Mark did not have Ghost at the time, but if he&#8217;s certain he&#8217;ll be doing this again in 9 months, it&#8217;s worth getting ASAP, while the install is still fresh.  After that, he&#8217;ll just have to install 9 months worth of hotfixes and Service Packs, 2 restarts at most.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little disingenuous to call all of those steps &#8220;Installing XP,&#8221; when in fact you&#8217;re installing quite a lot more than XP, namely all of the linux and apache stuff.  It may take 5 hours to restore the PC to the state at which you can do your job with it&#8211;no dispute there&#8211; but when I&#8217;ve restored my computer from a format, I don&#8217;t include the time it took to install and add 5 years worth of mods and patches to Half-Life (plus find that darned CD-Key), even though it&#8217;s obviously essential software.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve done the install, you can benefit from experience and backup your settings using the convenient feature XP provides, write down your key, clone your disk, and you&#8217;ll be done in an hour or so.  Plus you&#8217;ll have steps like &#8220;get beer from fridge; open beer&#8221; and &#8220;check shoelace tension.&#8221;</p>

<li id="comment-4071"><p>I&#8217;ve had my win2k installation going for about a year and a half and it&#8217;s just now starting to go goofy on me.  Do you know how I&#8217;ve got it to go for so long?  (Other than my hardware and software brilliance?)  Because I don&#8217;t install anything on it.  The worst thing you can do to your pristine Windows installation is to install a program on it!  I mean, what are you thinking?  If you ask B. Gates, he&#8217;ll tell you that Microsoft produces everything you should want.  Look for the next version of Windows; it wont allow you to install anything without paying extortion to MS first.</p>
<p>One more note: using ghost after finalizing your installation and making an image file of your hdd will save a ton of time when that IRC trojan analy rapes you.</p>

<li id="comment-4093"><p>The secret to a happy Windows installation is pretty straightforward: Stay pure and keep your software vertical.</p>
<p>Staying vertical means avoiding programs which are meant to modify or add to the behavior of other programs. No matter how tempting that keystroke saver or titlebar enhancement is, avoid it. No matter how tempting it is to let QuickTime or RealPlayer install themselves as browser plug-ins, don&#8217;t do it. Load these programs on their own and paste URLs when you want to stream something. Keep everything stand-alone and you won&#8217;t end up with a unique never-before-tested configuration when you start bumping versions on one app or another.</p>
<p>Similarly, staying pure means: Avoid hardware that needs special drivers. If a signed driver isn&#8217;t available, or if the hardware -requires- extra software to function, consider returning the hardware and picking something else up. As soon as you add Creative Labs audio-magic apps, nVidia desktop<br />
tweakers, Epson print managers, HP tool-tray on-the-fly burning integration, etc &#8212; you&#8217;ve started to veer away from the mainstream tested configurations.</p>
<p>By being a purist about this kind of thing, my work XP installation has been going strong since XP&#8217;s release, and my 2000 configuration never went stale.</p>
<p>I run Debian GNU/Linux at home, and there I exercise similar caution, avoiding installing unpackaged software at all cost. (I package it myself if I have to.) Periodically running debfoster and deborphan finds unneeded packages, and cruft finds unmanaged files. By keeping the system clean, I&#8217;ve been using and upgrading the same GNU/Linux desktop installation for nearly six years now.</p>

<p>1.  Do all this the first time.<br />
2.  Tweak everything to within an inch of it&#8217;s life.<br />
3.  Use a backup utility to make a complete copy of the system partition.  I use Ghost.<br />
4.  20 minutes or so to make the copy.<br />
5.  30 minutes to reinstall system partition.</p>

<li id="comment-4099"><p>XP is really no joy to install and configure, but once it is up and running, it&#8217;s actually not a bad little OS.  While still rife with security holes (I don&#8217;t think MS will ever get that right) and fragmentation issues, it at least has stability much more under control than Windows 98SE.</p>
<p>Get Mandrake 9.1 &#8211; install is a dream.  No driver issues.  You have all the software you need, and the new KDE kicks ass.  Love it.  Or get a mac.  They are pretty sweet little machines.</p>

<p>Course, I had to plunk down a good chunk of change for Norton Ghost a while ago, but to avoid that frustration again?  It was well worth it.  The latest version&#8217;s pretty nice actually, let&#8217;s you boot from a ghost floppy, and backup directly to a CD via a CD burner.  :)</p>

<li id="comment-4103"><p>Hey, I hate to burst your bubble, but:</p>
<p>You could have saved yourself a whole boatload of time and hassle.  Use the &#8220;System Restore&#8221; feature.  It&#8217;s pretty damn slick; you restore your system to the state it was in on a certain date.  Here&#8217;s some text copied from Technet on this:<br />
&lt;><br />
A. The System Restore feature of Microsoft Windows XP enables administrators to restore their computers to a previous state without losing personal data files (e.g. Word documents, graphic files, e-mail). System Restore actively monitors system file changes and some application file changes to record or store previous versions before the changes occurred. Users never have to think about taking system snapshots as System Restore automatically creates easily identifiable restore points, which the users can use to revert to a previous time. Restore points are created at the time of significant system events (such as application or driver install) and periodically (each day). Additionally, users can create and name their own restore points at any time. For more information, please see the System Restore (link deleted) document on TechNet.<br />
&lt;><br />
If you can&#8217;t find info on this, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:adamhe@speakeasy.org">adamhe@speakeasy.org</a> and I&#8217;ll hook you up.</p>

<li id="comment-4107"><p>Just a tip:</p>
<p>don&#8217;t use the /noguiboot switch in boot.ini. It gets rid of the cheesy splash screen but it causes more problems than it&#8217;s worth. What that  flag does is competely disable the bootvid.sys driver, which is not only responsible for the splash screen, but also the output from autochk if there&#8217;s a file system problem, and any bluescreens that might occur, even after the OS is loaded.</p>
<p>Use /sos instead. That will display what passes for a boot log in XP. Usually you&#8217;ll only see something like &#8220;Microsoft Windows XP Professional. 1 system processor. 1024MB memory, etc&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<li id="comment-4108"><p>Hmm. All your years of experience with Windows (as mentioned above) yet:</p>
<p>1) You don&#8217;t seem to know that you should reformat your drive (easily accomplished via the install CD) before reinstalling over a problem installation.</p>
<p>2) You don&#8217;t seem to know that the WPA code is not on the Windows box, it on the CD jewel case.</p>
<p>3) You don&#8217;t seem to know how to access Device Manager, even though there are numerous methods that can be employed.</p>
<p>4) You don&#8217;t seem to know to uncheck that checkbox (the one that&#8217;s titled, obscurely of course, since it&#8217;s in an MS GUI: &#8220;Show this screen every time Windows starts&#8221;) for the Windows XP Tour screen.</p>
<p>5) You don&#8217;t seem to know that very recent hardware (like a wireless network card) may requires drivers that are not available on the Windows install disk.</p>
<p>6) You don&#8217;t seem to know that Windows XP was installed by Step 14. </p>
<p>Somehow, I don&#8217;t think Widnows XP was the real problem in your fiasco.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-4109"><p>Since nobody who&#8217;s commenting now has bothered to read through the previous comments, I&#8217;m not sure why I should bother responding civilly, but here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>I was installing on a fresh partition.  My old install was still semi-usable and I didn&#8217;t want to wipe it until necessary.</p>
<p>My original CD is in my original retail box, both of which are stored in a location so safe even I don&#8217;t remember where it is.  The first thing I did when I bought it was create a disk image of it, from which I create backup CDs as necessary.  I use backup CDs exclusively on this particular laptop because my CD drive has a nasty tendency to scratch discs that are in the drive longer than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I upgraded from W2K last December and my wireless card continued to work.  XP touts easy wireless networking as one of its main features, so it honestly never occurred to me (a) that my old drivers would not work on a fresh install, and (b) that I would need to manually install any drivers at all.</p>
<p>XP was *not* installed by step 14, at which point I had no programs and no internet access, and it would have stopped working in 30 days because I hadn&#8217;t activated it yet.  I might possibly concede that it was installed by step 45, except that the defaults for XP are so hideously unusable that they actively work against my getting any productive work done.</p>
<p>And to those who missed the previous 3 times I explained this and are about to say &#8220;get a Mac&#8221; or &#8220;switch to Linux&#8221;, I also use both of those operating systems on a daily basis.  They have their own strengths and weaknesses, and I have had similarly bad days with them as well.  However, this particular laptop is used for work, and for reasons I don&#8217;t feel under any obligation whatsoever to explain, it needs to be running Windows XP.</p>

<li id="comment-4102"><p>So, how many of you fanboys here actually do this stuff for a living? What Mark did was essentially create a *nix box out of a windows box. Sure, it took five hours, but he finally got to where he can &#8220;work&#8221; on it. Jesus, man, just go get a freakin install of what you&#8217;re comfortable with. This tripe wasn&#8217;t really funny (if it was even meant to be&#8230;), <del>it actually reminded me so much of the stupid users that can&#8217;t figure out where the anykey is.</del></p>

<li id="comment-4110"><p>First of all, since I read every single comment up to the one I made, I&#8217;ll ignore your accusation.</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification about the separate partitions. That specific info wasn&#8217;t stated previously, or at least not clearly.</p>
<p>So you can&#8217;t find the original box for Windows XP? OK&#8230;erm&#8230;great. So now I&#8217;m trying to figure out how your lack of organization on your part = a faux pas on MS&#8217;s part?</p>
<p>Yes, MS touts wireless networking as easy, and it is. However, MS doesn&#8217;t tout installing PCI cards without drivers as easy, and it obviously wasn&#8217;t. Again you seem to point fingers in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>XP was &#8220;installed&#8221; by step 14. You heard the chime as you stated, right? That means Windows is &#8220;installed.&#8221; If it wasn&#8217;t installed you wouldn&#8217;t have heard a chime or have been presented with a desktop. All of your remaining steps are configuration steps (tweaking Windows, locating drivers for devices because you can&#8217;t find the right disk, installing software, etc.) not operating system installation steps. And no, this is not a semantics argument, just a fact. It&#8217;s also a fact which tends to make the title of your little diatribe unfairly misleading. Maybe &#8220;How to reinstall Windows XP and configure my laptop for work&#8221; would be far more appropriate? </p>
<p>Hmm. Without the hyperbole it loses something though, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<li id="comment-4111"><p>Mark,</p>
<p>I hope you don&#8217;t take this the wrong way, but I think you need to get out more. You are getting way too worked up about a trivial issue. </p>
<p>Upgrades are not always easy &#8211; and five or six hours is not that much time to me.</p>
<p>Finally, your comments such as &#8220;suck my tit&#8221; and various references to your mother being violated come off as plain wierd (i.e. NOT funny).</p>
<p>Without trying to insult you, all I can say is: a) this is a small thing b)it is not worth getting riled up about c)see a therapist about any other outstanding issues.</p>
