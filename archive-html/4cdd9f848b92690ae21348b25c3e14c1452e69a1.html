<p>Sam,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking for your insights into programming, not how your freakin travel plans are working out. Granted it&#8217;s your right to post whatever you want &#8211; I&#8217;m certainly not trying to tell you what to post. But I suspect that if you want to keep your readers you&#8217;ll cut back on the crap about your personal life. I suggest you take a lesson from Chris Brumme &#8211; that is truly a worthwhile blog.  Just an FYI.</p>

<p>I have a loooong list of things to say to people like this (and I can say many of them <a href="/web/20110910024225/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/19/teach_me_spanish_curse_words.html">in two languages</a>).  I certainly don&#8217;t speak for Sam, but to the people who have sent me similar letters, let me just say this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I must have missed the part where I was put under <em>any sort of obligation towards you whatsoever</em>.</strong></p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t cut it out, I&#8217;ll have no choice but to spider your site repeatedly, print it out, and tape it to the walls of my house.</p>

<li id="comment-3023"><p>I have no idea of the tone or content of letters you&#8217;ve received, however your reaction to the letter Sam received seems a little extreme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted it�s your right to post whatever you want &#8211; I�m certainly not trying to tell you what to post.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems reasonable.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I suspect that if you want to keep your readers you�ll cut back on the crap about your personal life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The word &#8220;crap&#8221; is a little harsh, but i don&#8217;t exactly see where he is saying that Sam is &#8216;obliged&#8217; to do anything. In fact, I see the complete opposite. He says that its Sam&#8217;s right to do whatever he wants and he is simply giving advice about maintaining readership &#8211; advice that Sam can either take or leave.</p>
<p>Your reaction:</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have missed the part where I was put under any sort of obligation towards you whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems offbase given the example cited. Now maybe you are completely justified in that response given the mail *you&#8217;ve* personally received, but we can&#8217;t tell unless you actually post one.</p>

<li id="comment-3024"><p>Mark: Seems like just about everyone walks around with a sense of entitlement these days. It&#8217;s everywhere, from the small stuff (&#8220;your blog is boring, entertain me!&#8221;) to the big (&#8220;my free Blogger/Fotoblog/Whatever account isn&#8217;t working the way I expect&#8230; damn you all to hell!&#8221;).</p>
<p>When I see comments like that, my first thought is: &#8220;If someone is giving you something for nothing, say &#8216;thank you&#8217;, or walk the fuck away.&#8221; A little gratitude goes a long way.</p>
<p>On the flipside, if you&#8217;re performing in front of an audience, it seems to me that there may actually be *some* obligation that is owed the crowd. I won&#8217;t try to define the terms of that obligation with any precision, but it feels as if it exists. The audience deserves respect&#8230; not in any specific form, but thought should be given to their needs.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&#8217;m saying is, maybe you *do* have an obligation&#8230; not to that specific individual, but to your audience as a whole. And the audience has an obligation to respect your generosity&#8230; not the individual words you post, but certainly the giving spirit in which they&#8217;re posted.</p>

<li id="comment-3027"><p>This discussion is, of course, predicated on the assumption that Sam *cares* whether Saul subscribes to his blog.</p>
<p>That is to say, if you care about having (maintaining) an audience, then you need to take their tastes into account. You can pretend that you don&#8217;t care (some audiences dig that arrogance thang) but, when it comes down to it, we all know you do.</p>
<p>The only real freedom comes if you truly don&#8217;t care&#8230;</p>

<li id="comment-3028"><p>I continue to wrestle over why it is that I blog.  Is it for me in a sense of identity, catharsis, creativity, something else?  Or is it for the readers: friends, relatives, just anyone who drops by the site?  I wonder at times if answering the &#8220;why&#8221; will help me better determine what sort of relationship I have with the readers.</p>
<p>Usually, I&#8217;m pretty convinced that I blog in order to have conversation that &#8220;persists.&#8221;  That&#8217;s probably the foremost reason why this sort of feedback seems so insolent: it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve forced anyone to read Our Story, if you don&#8217;t want to participate in the conversation, then go away.  Any criticism that I receive is generally met with a link to our Content Policy: </p>

<p>I also never cease to be amazed at how often Heather Armstrong witnesses this exact same behavior:  </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know&#8230;maybe the depersonalization of the Internet makes people forget that there&#8217;s another person at the other end of the wire.</p>

<li id="comment-3029"><p>In my view the depersonalization of content is the real danger. Like the way people say, &#8220;It&#8217;s just business.&#8221; Depersonalization allows us to rationalize beliefs and behaviour a person would never allow. Depersonalization is control. Depersonalization separates our selves from our works. It is a pretense built on a lie. I value much more code when I understand the mind that created it. And I won&#8217;t trust code &#8211; or anything else &#8211; separated from the passion, the heart and the determination of the person behind it.</p>

<li id="comment-3030"><p>Frankly I&#8217;m offended over that comment. Saul grudginly admits that Sam can post anything he wants, but the whole tone of the comment is disrespectful and offensive. </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read Sam&#8217;s site, but unless the post that elicited that response was the first time he ever posted about something personal, I dare say that his audience is used to the varied nature of his entries.</p>
<p>My blog is purely a personal one. I write &#8216;personal crap&#8217; almost exclusively. Occasionally, I&#8217;ll post entries about what I&#8217;ve learned about Movable Type or some script that I&#8217;ve found. Hey, guess what? Of my readership, maybe two are interested. The rest skip those entries. That&#8217;s their prerogative. Not once has someone told me I needed to not post things like that in order to keep my audience.</p>
<p>If Saul isn&#8217;t interested in the personal entries he can just *gasp* not read them!</p>

<li id="comment-3031"><p>Pedantic.  Pompous.  Utterly pretentious and self indulgent.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s me, according to one (or maybe two) people.</p>
<p>After two years, I&#8217;m still hovering in the 300-400 hits per week range.</p>
<p>And when the bit about the pedantry came to life, it occurred to me that I have better places to post about Webgeeking or other Stuff I Know About.</p>
<p>Personal sites are funny that way, that people might actually TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES.  Omigod, he is a narcissist!  We cannot let that infamy stand!</p>
<p>(Isn&#8217;t a certain amount of narcissism prerequisite to the task of building a site with one&#8217;s own name on it, in the first place?)</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>

<li id="comment-3032"><p>I think Sam&#8217;s commentator is simply rude. I guess a consensus etiquette for blogs hasn&#8217;t yet crystallised (blogequette? urrgh). I think to balance this guy&#8217;s line, it should be considered perfectly acceptable for Sam to delete the comment.</p>

<li id="comment-3033"><p>Wow. I&#8217;m glad my blog isn&#8217;t popular enough for me to get stupid posts and emails like this. My initial instinct would be to send a response with 3 words in it </p>
<p> &#8220;Go fuck yourself&#8221; </p>
<p>Hopefully I&#8217;d calm down I&#8217;d probably end up sending something like Mark&#8217;s suggested response although mine would probably be harsher.</p>

<li id="comment-3034"><p>I write whatever I write when I hit the keyboard. Often I have no control over it. Sometimes I delete stuff that just reads as rubbish, and sometimes a short post becomes a long massive one. I feel great everytime I get a new reader, even if they don&#8217;t stay for long. But I don&#8217;t write to give an audience what they want because I can&#8217;t. I can only write what flows when I hit the keyboard.</p>
<p>I like the mix of personal and technical on most sites. If I didn&#8217;t I wouldn&#8217;t read it. I do wish I could be more creative at times, but hey that&#8217;s just me. Ken Walker&#8217;s disclaimer is brilliant.</p>

<li id="comment-3036"><p>Saul did two things that were very wrong.</p>
<p>First, communications like this, however much or little appreciated by the blogger, should be private. Sam may well want to know why someone is no longer interested in his blog. But however Saul worded this, it is criticism of a personal nature &#8211; and thuis should have been emailed to Sam and not commented.</p>
<p>Second, Saul &#8211; like many when the subject of spam comes up &#8211; seems to forget something very basic to PC work. It&#8217;s called the DELETE button. Just as Sam is not obligated to write solely about his programming insights, Saul is not obligated to read everything that comes down the RSS pipeline either.</p>

<p>I like sites with colour. I like sites with a bit of humanity. All the best sites mix &#8220;target&#8221; content, like programming insights, with personal anecdotes and stories.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d get a bloody computer manual if I only wanted programming stuff.</p>

<li id="comment-3043"><p>If there is a point in blogging, it is in that they are personal texts, random crap reflecting the author&#8217;s immediate thoughts.  If people start limiting themselves to what their &#8220;audience&#8221; wants, then they are not bloggers, but columnists.  There are plenty of those around.  The fact that people go and seek out blogs when there are extremely competent people writing interesting columns, both in print and on the internet, tells me that there is something in particular that is attractive about this form.</p>

<li id="comment-3047"><p>Whilst obviously everyone has a right to blog whatever they want, if enough users either don&#8217;t want to see at all or really want to see personal life entries, wouldn&#8217;t having two versions of a blog be a good idea?</p>
<p>The default having everything, and then &#8220;tech&#8221; and &#8220;personal&#8221; versions. Or if you really want to get snazzy, give users options to control what individual categories they see?</p>
<p>I think user customization of blogs is something to look at for the future&#8230;</p>

<li id="comment-3048"><p>&#8220;wouldn�t having two versions of a blog be a good idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it would, because the tech people would see every personal blog entry as one less tech blog entry unless the author is willing to ensure that (s)he posts to both blogs daily in equal amounts.</p>
<p>Dave Hyatt split up his blog into tech (safari) and personal and the end result seems to be that blog entries have become less frequent on either side. So I don&#8217;t think this approach would really satisfy many.</p>

<li id="comment-3050"><p>It&#8217;s a coincidence that almost the exact same thing happened on my blog last night: a long time reader of mine returned (after my six month blog exile due to life interfering) to tell me my new writings were a &#8220;snooze&#8221; and I should haul my sorry ass out and do something interesting so I could write about it.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know whether it was that she hit a nerve (I&#8217;ve been feeling sort of sorry for myself: new city, father&#8217;s illness, etc.) or that being a girl, I just take criticism differently, but I was all like &#8220;You&#8217;re right! Mea culpa! I&#8217;ll try and do better!&#8221;</p>

<li id="comment-3051"><p>I had a website until a couple years ago when I just  no longer had time or interest for it. I remember getting a few e-mails complaining to me about what I felt like saying or putting on my site, and I remember laughing at them. It was ridiculous.

<p>To me it&#8217;s akin to walking into McDonalds and saying something like &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that you don&#8217;t have the shamrock shake everyday, so I&#8217;m not coming back here ever again&#8221;.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good analogy.  If enough people complained, they *would* add the Shamrock Shake to the menu.  Its a simple matter of making $$$.</p>
<p>This is different from a personal website that generates zero income, as all the complaining in the world might make no difference.</p>
<p>For a website that does rely on traffic as a revenue stream, it might, indeed, make a difference.</p>

<li id="comment-3058"><p>&#8220;cut back on the crap about your personal life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark, in my original post (#2) I rasied issue about the exact same thing. I thought calling his personal like &#8220;crap&#8221; was going too far. </p>
<p>However, your response about an author having no obligation to his readers (which I have no issue with) didn&#8217;t seem relevant given that Saul&#8217;s comment states &#8220;it�s your right to post whatever you want &#8211; I�m certainly not trying to tell you what to post&#8221;.</p>
<p>He was simply saying, &#8220;this is the reason why I&#8217;m unsubscribing from your blog&#8221; and offering up advice which Sam could either take or leave. I really don&#8217;t see where all the outrage comes from. Most of the posts thus far are hysterical rants about &#8220;users having no right to complain about free content&#8221; and that users who don&#8217;t like the content of a blog can &#8220;simply choose to not read the blog&#8221; &#8211; which is exactly what Saul was saying he  planned on doing!?!</p>

<li id="comment-3059"><p>I think what&#8217;s most offensive about that comment is the tone. We all have different reasons for blogging, I suspect some bloggers do care about keeping an audience, and we shouldn&#8217;t all be so thin skinned that we can&#8217;t accept some constructive criticism.</p>
<p>But sometimes in being &#8216;helpful&#8217; people forget to be polite. Now, I may be showing how naive I am, but, regardless of whether we&#8217;re talking about online or offline communication, I expect to be communicated with in a respectful manner. Call me weird, but that&#8217;s me.</p>
<p>If Saul really meant to offer constructive advice he should have given the wording of his message a little more thought. As it stands, his advice is lost among all the rudeness.</p>
<p>And, I have to wonder why he believes Sam would care about losing him as a reader when he himself doesn&#8217;t seem to much care about Sam? Oops. Sorry. I forgot &#8230; I&#8217;m talking about the internet. We don&#8217;t do the feeling thing around here. My mistake.</p>

<li id="comment-3060"><p>Mark &#8211; you&#8217;re a star. I can&#8217;t count the number of times I&#8217;ve had people writing in to say that either I&#8217;m boring them with the personal stuff on my site or I&#8217;m boring them on the technical stuff on my site. It&#8217;s always, &#8220;I love X, but I don&#8217;t really want to read about Y&#8221;. The problem with these e-mails is that they can never agree about what the good stuff is and what should be abandoned. Universally these people think I write with no other intention than to give them the benefit of my expertise (for nothing) in the one area that they&#8217;re interested in. My interests be damned&#8230;</p>
<p>Our weblogs are representations of ourselves in cyberspace. They are mostly not professional ventures with potential revenus &#8211; we have no obligation to maximise traffic for ourselves because there&#8217;s no corresponding increase in revenue. For these reasons we have no need to determine one demographic and target them precisely. There&#8217;s an aspect of weblog writing which is to reveal oneself &#8211; one&#8217;s interests and passions &#8211; in order to meet and connect with other people who share some or all of those passions. If we self-censor to the extent that we&#8217;re nothing but audience-satisfying machines then the thin cord that separates online self from offline self is severed. Our sites become costumes that we wear &#8211; betrayals of ourselves &#8211; and we&#8217;ll never connect with other people on that basis.</p>
<p>And after all, we all write with a full view of the consequences &#8211; if people find us boring they go away, if they like what we write they stay. All of us can check our stats on any given day and see precisely how many people think we&#8217;re interesting and if we want to we can change our ways. But god knows it&#8217;s not our responsibility to do so!</p>

<li id="comment-3063"><p>Jeebus.  MikeyC, you must have worked for (and been brainwashed by) Customer Service before, because you actually believe besides the &#8220;crap&#8221; comment that Saul&#8217;s words were legitimate.</p>
<p>As a person who HAS worked in that service before, this is worded almost exactly like an irate customer  complaint who contradicts himself &#8212; he says post whatever you want, but tells you exactly what to post (cut down on the personal life).  He uses offending words like &#8220;freaking&#8230; crap&#8230;&#8221; and then cites another blog (Chris) as a comparison.  It&#8217;s no different from someone complaining about, say, furniture, and going to one store and telling the Sales Rep that he&#8217;s taking their business elsewhere because the other furniture in the other store is cheaper/better/doesn&#8217;t speak about its personal life.</p>
<p>Ah, gimme a break.  It&#8217;s like people who ask to censor TV.  For God&#8217;s sake, just change the channel.</p>

<li id="comment-3064"><p>it seems that blog authors voluntarily take on at least some obligation to the readers.  standards compliance is an easy example.</p>
<p>it is generally agreed that standards compliance benefits the whole community, so it is accepted by many blog authors (including mark) as worth the work.</p>
<p>interactions on a personal level are harder to quantify, but i wonder if the whole community wouldn&#8217;t benefit from some sort of code between the author and reader.</p>

<p>All right, here&#8217;s my code:</p>
<p>I get to say whatever I want on my own turf, and suffer the consequences all by myself, including you ignoring me.  If you don&#8217;t like that, you get to go start your own weblog and say whatever you want on your own turf, and suffer the consequences all by yourself, including me ignoring you.</p>

<li id="comment-3066"><p>re: &#8220;here&#8217;s my code:&#8221;</p>
<p>allow me to suffix my last statement by saying that the first violation of that code could very well be the pervasive attitude of Saul&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>you have an excellent point in that there are very definate things that the readers just don&#8217;t (and shouldn&#8217;t) get to control.  but what type of response will most effectively silence dissenting voices, and communicate the reader&#8217;s proper role not only to the dissenter, but the general community?</p>
<p>it&#8217;s possible these incidents aren&#8217;t avoidable and the best way to deal with them is to behead the ignorants involved, but i wish for something else.</p>

<li id="comment-3067"><p>Mark,</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you (at least in theory) want to be informed of those consequences? Assuming of course that they weren&#8217;t freaking obvious.</p>
<p>Some criticism *is* constructive, after all.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-3070"><p>Michael: absolutely, I&#8217;m all for constructive criticism.  Heck, over on my fledgling Spanish blog ( <a href="/web/20110910024225/http://es.diveintomark.org/">http://es.diveintomark.org/</a> ), I have people *correcting my grammar* every day.  Now *that&#8217;s* humbling (and constructive).</p>
<p>Saul&#8217;s comment, on the other hand, is just pointless.  It boils down to &#8220;be more interesting&#8221; (more interesting to me, specifically).  That&#8217;s the blog equivalent of someone standing behind you in the arcade saying &#8220;move faster, shoot better.&#8221;  Dude, here&#8217;s a quarter, get a life.</p>

<p>My apologies for beating a dead horse but Saul was not saying, &#8220;be more interesting to me&#8221; but that he was &#8220;no longer going to read Sam&#8217;s blog because he  doesn&#8217;t find what Sam has to say interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe we are dealing with subtle semantics here, and maybe his comment was just a thinly veiled threat to &#8220;be more interesting &#8211; or else!&#8221; but I just happen to see it differently.</p>

<li id="comment-3072"><p>Mark, I fully agree with your postings about your life. A blog is not only a technical insight magazine, editorialized, homogenized and pasteurized, but an account of a person that creates connections with other people  &#8211; we read as much about a person&#8217;s life as about their particular prowess at any endeavor, and thus we give more attention to their words &#8211; that person becoming real.<br />
Besides that, I am a little voyeur.</p>
