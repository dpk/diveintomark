<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>Twitter is an amazing success story in terms of rapid user uptake and flattering press.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I feel I deserve an enormous share of that flattering press.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>I had a chance to speak with the team a while back about the wild ride they&#8217;ve been on.  At that time they were fielding spikes of up to 11,000 requests per second across some 16 cores with very little caching thrown into the mix to mitigate. No wonder their site had been feeling slow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m going to pretend that everyone has these problems.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>It sounded like they had a good plan at the time, though. Roll in a rack of new servers, look into doing substantial caching, and move beyond a single database server. The normal road to sanity employed by most any web application experiencing rapid growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a software developer, therefore this is obviously a hardware problem.</p>

<p>It seems like at least one of their developers felt this standard approach to scaling was too much work and decided to share his feelings about that in an interview.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck you, Alex.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>On some level, I can empathize with this sentiment. Rails makes the act of developing such a pleasant experience that when you need to follow the same scaling path as every other shared-nothing stack, the contrast can feel stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My ego is the size of Montana.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>But I would still like to address two points raised in the interview. First, Alex mentions that scaling the application by adding more Mongrels and servers eventually puts a greater strain on the database. That&#8217;s absolutely correct, but also the intended consequence, not an unexpected side-effect. There should have been no surprises there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only surprise here is that you&#8217;re treating my utter disregard for scalability as a bug, when it is in fact a feature.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>Scaling is the act of removing bottlenecks. When you remove one bottleneck (like application code execution), you tend to reveal another (like database queries). That&#8217;s natural and means you&#8217;re making progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rails is an ogre, and ogres have layers.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>Second, when you work with open source and you discover new requirements not met by the software, it&#8217;s your shining opportunity to give something back. Rather than just sit around idle waiting for some vendor to fix your problems, you get the unique chance of being a steward of your own destiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My utter disregard for performance issues is entirely your fault.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>This is especially true with frameworks like Rails that are implemented in high-level languages like Ruby. The barriers to contribution are exceptionally low.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am high as a kite.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>In this case, it seems that Twitter requires more sophisticated ways of talking to many databases at the same time. Alex puts it a little black and white with &#8220;&#8230;there&#8217;s no facility in Rails to talk to more than one database at a time&#8221;, which isn&#8217;t really true, but it could definitely be done better.  Last I spoke with Twitter, we discussed this and they sounded enthusiastic about being able to further this area of Rails.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t distinguish between people fluffing me because they want something, or fluffing me because they just can&#8217;t help themselves.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing to hear that they&#8217;ve forsaken that opportunity for an arms-crossed alternative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s disappointing to discover that there are people in the world who disagree with me.</p>

<blockquote class="fisk">
<p>Once the stress of having to deal with that in the moment subsides, I&#8217;m convinced that the team will grow beyond the blame game, get their hands dirty as full participants in an open source community, and contribute back their advances to the framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know this sucks, and I&#8217;m waiting for you to fix it so I can take credit for it.</p>

<li id="comment-9094"><p>&#8220;Putting words in other people&#8217;s mouthes [sic] is easier&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>When &#8220;translating&#8221; someone&#8217;s words in this fashion, &#8220;putting words in other people&#8217;s mouths&#8221; is not an apt description of it.  Literally, sure, but there&#8217;s the comedy.  But your insult comes from the implication, not the literal meaning.  Usually the term connotes some kind of deception.  Here there is no such deception, the author is being very plain about it.  It is clear that what we are reading is the author&#8217;s take on what has been said, which is his own commentary&#8230; which is something he&#8217;s taken his time to articulate.</p>
<p>The author is being neither deceptive nor lazy, so I don&#8217;t see any way that your criticism holds.</p>

<li id="comment-9100"><p>Can&#8217;t we all just get along?  One platform, framework, language, IDE, versioning system, licensing scheme, or operating system that is the answer to everything is a monoculture that leads to stagnation and halfassed, lazy solutions to problems.  Are we not all trying to be good little monkeys and write our REST applications, XML this-that-and-the-other open and interoperable formats that can share and care and make the world a better place?  So a ruby on rails app turns out to not scale as well as expected.  This does not invalidate it for every use.  I myself make a living on a red-headed stepchild of a language (which I will not name, for fear my it is used to dismiss my comment) that is inappropriate for many uses but fits my business model very nicely.  Sheesh, people.  Every time somebody aggrandizes their toolkit-du-jour over anything else, God kills a kitten.</p>

<li id="comment-9106"><p>Mark, your post is quite unfair and also pretty uninformed (besides not being very clever or funny IMO). Your motives seem rather questionable and the whole thing smacks of sour grapes. Surely, DHH is very opinionated and as such he can reasonably expect harsh criticism coming back at him, but this just seems to be another low blow in a greater flamewar directed against him as of late (and should it surprise anyone that the most vocal contributers on this seem to be coming out of the Python community?). I don&#8217;t see anything in his response to the interview with Alex which would warrant this kind of attack and i have a feeling you may come to regret posting such nonsense before the day is done.</p>

<li id="comment-9112"><p>I&#8217;m proud of what Twitter has achieved with Rails. I&#8217;m certainly of no illusions that Rails is perfect nor that Ruby is a speed daemon&#8230;. Alex pointed the finger at the database himself in the interview. When they added enough Mongrels to deal with the computational bottleneck, he said they started to have trouble at the database and needed to add more databases (and was thus disappointed at what Rails had to offer to support that).</p>
<p>This is a quote by DHH in the comments.</p>
<p>I tried to speak in clear and balanced language in that interview, but clearly I didn&#8217;t accomplish as much. </p>
<p>This is Mr. Alex Payne, responding.  </p>
<p>It seems an American shows he is pretty respectful of a Dane(someone else calls his nationality into play on DHH&#8217;s blog), Mr. Pilgrim just plays it for laughs.  The net benefit of all this is all of the players get more press. No one is too delicate for this type of fight.</p>

<li id="comment-9113"><p>Sebastian, Andy et. al., David expects, nay, demands a religious zealotry, and this is the kind of attitude we have to guard against in the Rails community. To pretend that the criticisms coming towards David are from outside Rails(TM) community is akin to sticking one&#8217;s head in the sand. </p>
<p>He is a talented guy, no doubt, he created Rails and is passionate about it, no doubt about that either, but this doesn&#8217;t mean that we owe supine allegiance to everything he has to say about everything. Based on this un-questioning conformity by the Rails community at large, he has managed to embarrass us all on numerous occasions. Twitter being merely the latest Faux Pas.</p>
<p>Just like DHH doesn&#8217;t owe anyone sh*t, by the same token, Rails and Ruby community doesn&#8217;t owe him blind allegiance either! He has to stop making these scenes and attacking people if they don&#8217;t agree with him. He has acted as a bully towards his own community. We shouldn&#8217;t be so quick to blame others and warn of &#8220;regret&#8221;ful consequences just because they happen to notice his almost abusive behaviour.</p>
<p>Stop feeding the guy&#8217;s Messiah complex. Please!</p>

Honestly, DHH seems like a really sharp guy, but there is no question that both of his recent posts about Twitter were entirely out of line.

<li id="comment-9115"><p>Damn it. I like your writing Mark. I value your opinions.</p>
<p>But why the hostility?  This is just viciousness.  Your entire point point could be summarized simply as &#8220;DHH is arrogant and he doesn&#8217;t care about scaling.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Is DHH arrogant?  Blatantly.  So is Guido.  Likewise Larry Wall, and Alan Kay, etc.  Comes with the territory.</p>
<p>However, Rails <i>is</i> scaling.  On a number of high profile sites.</p>
<p>Your response to the suggestion that it is easy to contribute to Rails is patently absurd given that one of the Twitter folks&#8217; biggest problems with Rails has been fixed two ways in three days.  One solution in seventy lines of code.</p>
<p>In short, let&#8217;s be done with the hate.  I&#8217;ll start.  I love Ruby, I love Rails, I love Python, I love Django.  I think Django does some things better than Rails, and some benchmarks have it performing considerably better than Rails.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t see anything that deserved this type of backlash.  David could have simply acknowledged the short coming, and the encouraged the community to solve it. </p>

<p>DHH did not create anything. Rails is a simple collection of ActionPack+ActiveRecord, none of which was created or inspired by DHH in any way. He is basically a very talented marketing person who collected a bunch of free scripts created by other people and PRed the hell out of it, making a name for himself. I bet nobody even knows who ACTUALLY wrote ActionPack or ActiveRecord, two libraries Rails is composed of.</p>

<li id="comment-9132"><p>Ahhh, the mud slinging.  Personally, I didn&#8217;t find Mark&#8217;s entry childish or anything.  Just another (funny) point of view.  It&#8217;s no secret that DHH has an arrogant streak, but I&#8217;m not going to judge him for it.  I&#8217;m pretty bad myself.  But as others have pointed out, it took very little time for viable solutions to show up once people were properly motivated.  (An interesting challenge.  Good PR.  Whatever.)  I doubt I will ever have a particularly strong need for these solutions since I&#8217;ve stuck to fairly small, niche Rails applications, but it&#8217;s nice to have them, and so I&#8217;m not going to object to this giant kerfluffle.</p>

<li id="comment-9139"><p>My mother always told me that when you say something bad about someone (DHH is &#8220;arrogant&#8221; or whatever) it reflects worse on you than on the person you are talking about. I&#8217;d bet a good 95% of the people who dis DHH haven&#8217;t actually met DHH. When you do meet him you&#8217;ll discover he&#8217;s generous, kind, a good listener, and more than happy to help you in any way he can (within reason). DHH is also a leader and leaders have strong opinions. Anyone with strong opinions is bound to piss off 50% of the people.</p>

<li id="comment-9148"><p>I can&#8217;t comment on the humour as it&#8217;s subjective — I don&#8217;t find this amusing obviously  — but I do find the general sentiment to be quite bitter. Mark, as a long-term reader — I was sad when you started blogging less — I&#8217;m disappointed to see you stoop to this sort of nasty commentary.</p>
<p>As for some of the comments; I am simultaneously perplexed and disappointed to hear this clamouring about &#8216;cults&#8217; and &#8216;messiah complex&#8217; and other nonsense. Firstly I am a Rails developer. I don&#8217;t belong to any cults and I don&#8217;t care to be associated with such just because of my choice in frameworks. Ridiculous! Secondly I think folk should resist reflex to smear David with such nasty and personal comments. It&#8217;s unreasonable and plain rude. </p>
<p>David is a proud and forceful person, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t have at least a modicum of manners.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if you can&#8217;t make your point without being rude about it, there obviously isn&#8217;t much value to what you&#8217;re saying.</p>

<p>I must admit, I was a bit disappointed by his post. There are ways to handle criticism, and his diatribe was not one of them.</p>
<p>Rails has been amazingly successful, but sometimes you have to swallow some get-the-fuck-back-down-to-earth medicine.</p>

<li id="comment-9169"><p>It does no good to complain that people will avoid Rails even for apps the have 11K hits per month. The fact is, most people writing those apps *hope* that they&#8217;ll get 11K/sec. And if they get there, and the app starts to crumble, it&#8217;s no fun, period. It&#8217;s stressful. It&#8217;s more fun to be pouring champagne at that point. And one more fact is, while Rails is quite nice and productive, it&#8217;s not the *only* nice and productive framework. There are other nice, productive frameworks that do scale better, and it&#8217;d be nice if the Rails folks took some lessons from that instead of wasting time with defensive web postings.</p>

<li id="comment-9177"><p>Eugueny, from everything I&#8217;ve seen &#8212; including going back through changelogs to the beginning &#8212; ActiveRecord was DHH&#8217;s implementation in Rails. He&#8217;s never claimed to have <em>invented the concept</em> of the AR pattern, but Rails was his creation to start with, which is why he can be overprotective of it. It&#8217;s his baby. And let&#8217;s be fair &#8212; it&#8217;s not as if all the other contributors aren&#8217;t getting mentioned throughout changelogs, Trac check-ins, and so on.</p>
<p>Mark&#8217;s post is still funny, and I think DHH does often come across as arrogant. I also, however, think most of the problems with Rails will be solved with or without his active assistance. He may think it&#8217;s a terrible idea, for example, to make Rails take advantage of a given database engine&#8217;s validation, logic and prepared SQL statements, but if enough other Rails developers think that just perhaps there is value in basic frickin&#8217; fundamental things everybody else learned 20 frickin&#8217; years ago,* he will be routed around. Arrogant or not, he&#8217;s right when he says &#8212; in so many words &#8212; that&#8217;s one of the virtues of open source development.</p>
<p>* Not that I am taking a stand on the performance value of letting the database do as much as work as possible rather than your interpreted language. Ahem.</p>

<li id="comment-9182"><p>So this is what happens when a bunch of kids who can&#8217;t program and know nothing about language design get together and slap-fight about the latest super-high-level scripting tool that they learned about from Wired magazine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll think of all of you the next time it takes 30 seconds to load a web page with nothing but simple text on it (!) and is 3x as large as it should be because you can&#8217;t even write HTML without a WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>We need another net-bubble-burst to clear you folks out &#8230;</p>
