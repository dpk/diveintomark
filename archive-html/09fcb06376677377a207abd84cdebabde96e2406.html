<p>Now that I&#8217;ve completed my move to Linux (sorry Mac fanboys, the install was flawless and everything worked out of the box), someone emailed me to suggest that I update <a href="/web/20110806090047/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/01/essentials">my essential software list</a>.  So here you go.</p>

<li><a href="/web/20110806090047/http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, which is an ancient African word meaning &#8220;can&#8217;t install Debian&#8221;.</li>

<li id="comment-6739"><p>I use GNOME desktop so, most of your apps aren&#8217;t in my list. I use Linux mainly for work stuff: svn, ruby, lighttpd, liferea reader, gaim, firefox, google maps, and xmms. Evolution for e-mail, because i&#8217;m not a freak of e-mail (check twice a day).

<li id="comment-6740"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>just wondering why you use GNOME, when half of your applications are KDE anyway and some of those missing are in KDE already (IIRC, Quicksilver = Katapult in KDE). And sorry, KMail is way more powerful than Thunderbird &#8212; I tried it just week ago and I am glad to be back in KMail.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<li class=me id="comment-6741"><p>I like Nautilus better than Konqueror, GNOME Terminal better then KTerm (edit: oops, it&#8217;s called Konsole), and GNOME Deskbar better than Katapult.  But yeah, I end up with KDE libs loaded most of the time. :)</p>

<li id="comment-6742"><p>Pan-OS: Firefox (default browser outside of OS X).</p>
<p>Windows: Paint Shop Pro, Trillian, ActivePerl, PuTTY, FlashFXP, EditPad Pro.</p>
<p>Mac OS X: Apple Mail, iPhoto, iTunes (all three of them by active choice and not just settling for what ships), Flip4Mac (WMV QuickTime codec), VLC (because its Mac GUI sucks less than mplayer and appears to be actively developed), SubEthaEdit, NetNewsWire, Acquisition (made by Dave Watanabe, the Soup Nazi of independent Mac application developers), Inquisitor (ditto), Adium, Growl, Synergy (for showing iTunes bezels), Camino, OmniWeb (default browser), Safari, Opera (why yes, I am a web developer).</p>
<p>Linux (and the command line parts of OS X): I look forward to installing Ubuntu when my MacBook gets delivered. Until then, some outdated and meager notions: nano/pico (and emacs over vi on the account of being slightly less insane if I have to choose), curl over wget (but not by much), Galeon over Konqueror (built-in vertical tabs; I prefer Firefox over Galeon), GIMP over&#8230; wait, just say GIMP, GAIM, apt-get.</p>
<p>Many of those are proprietary applications. As a software developer, this bugs me more than I&#8217;d like to admit. As a user, old habits die hard, and by &#8220;old habits die hard&#8221; I really mean &#8220;not switching unless confronted with a better alternative or slightly worse but with available source&#8221; instead of &#8220;I&#8217;m a retarded bigot&#8221;.</p>

<li id="comment-6743"><p>Here some other programs you might be interrested in:</p>
<p><a href="/web/20110806090047/http://listengnome.free.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://listengnome.free.fr/</a> &#8211; Listen which supports my iPod perfectly, has got a very nice gtk frontend. I even like it more then amarok since it fetches more lyrics, the wikipedia support looks a bit better. And I like it since GTK looks better than Qt.</p>
<p>I havn&#8217;t tried diva by now (<a href="/web/20110806090047/http://www.diva-project.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.diva-project.org/</a>) but it tries to create an easy to use, scalable, open-source video editing software for the GNOME desktop.</p>
<p>Instead of Konversation I use X-Chat (<a href="/web/20110806090047/http://xchat.org/" rel="nofollow">http://xchat.org/</a>) which just rocks :-) Check out tomboy. It&#8217;s a very cool way for managing notes on the desktop and don&#8217;t forget to install beagle since the deskbar supports it :-)</p>
<p>And finally &#8212; use gvim instead of emacs :D *scnr*</p>

<li class=me id="comment-6745"><p>Oh yeah, I have Beagle too.  It&#8217;s very pretty, but I haven&#8217;t used it &#8220;for real&#8221; yet.  I never used Spotlight either, or Google Desktop Search, or Copernicus, or whatnot.  Don&#8217;t really know why; I guess they just don&#8217;t match up with how I want to find stuff.  I&#8217;m not sure how I find stuff.  They also tend to uncover a lot of stuff that I would prefer to keep buried.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s healthy to have your entire life&#8217;s work a constant distance away.  This isn&#8217;t about excluding specific directories, I know Beagle can do that.  It&#8217;s more about &#8220;show me all the email messages that contain these keywords, except the ones from Randi after 1999, Kim after 1998 or between 1989 and 1991, and the ones I sent to the info-mac moderators in 1993.&#8221;  Is there a desktop search engine that helps you lose things?  That would be very useful.  Really.</p>

<li id="comment-6749"><p>GNOME Terminal a KTerm are bloatware. Any X Terminal Emulator that lets you change the background &#8220;picture&#8221; is bloatware &#8211; xterm is powerful, simple and chaperons 90% of communication with my computer.</p>
<p>GNOME looks nicer than KDE and is easier to use IMO but <a href="/web/20110806090047/http://www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/" rel="nofollow">Ion3</a> is a graphical <i>usable</i> interface for people who value keyboard navigation and hate the mouse.</p>

<li id="comment-6756"><p>I actually love Epiphany as my default web browser. It&#8217;s even got some extensions such as AdBlock, although it doesn&#8217;t support those that Firefox uses. Epiphany may look like a dumbed-down version of Firefox at first, but it&#8217;s well integrated into GNOME (which also means having a session manager built in as long as you don&#8217;t close it both manually AND cleanly (you have to either have GNOME quit it or be evil and kill it using a signal; I know that&#8217;s dumb, but it makes sense in a weird kind of way)) and a real pleasure to use. I especially like its highly usable tab-based interface and its search bookmarks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s efficient and It Doesn&#8217;t Suck (or at least not as much as other browsers do ;)). I&#8217;d be even happier if it used the GNOME keyring in order to store web passwords. Oh well. Will have to wait for that feature, I guess.</p>

<p>Gnus is fabulous feature-wise, but it&#8217;s just so *slow*, especially accessing remote inboxes over imap.

<li id="comment-6764"><p>Mark,</p>
<p>I really respect and admire your decision to switch to linux. I have been using Linux full-time for about a year now havn&#8217;t looked back once. I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>From your post, I realized that Linux really needs something like quicksilver: something that will change the way they use their computer. &#8220;Openoffice.org does what Word does&#8221;, etc, IMO does not want to make people change their operating system. Stuff like amarok and Xgl/Compiz are getting there, but isn&#8217;t quite that &#8220;killer app&#8221; that you can barely live without once you&#8217;ve used it (much like quicksilver).</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to GNOME3 and KDE4, hoping that they&#8217;ll innovate upon the modern desktop and truly change the way a person uses their computer.</p>

<p>my firefox set up is almost identical. i rarely see ads at all. the filtering tools are amazingly effective.</p>
<p>emacs, natch. </p>
<p>for backups of data, i use DAVs connecting to my boutique email provider, fastmail.fm ($ but worth it), who provide IMAP, DAVs, file storage, etc etc. i can use mutt or thunderbird with it&#8230;with IMAP my client is a matter of daily whim.</p>
<p>i replaced open office with abiword and gnumeric, but honestly i very rarely use these. </p>
<p>i go between mocp and rhythmbox for music. mocp is nice, as mutt is to thunderbird, mocp is to graphical music players. </p>
<p>i also use elinks from time to time. its nice to know you can live in a console if you have to.</p>

<li id="comment-6779"><p>I&#8217;m contemplating the setup of a Linux box. These lists of software options are incredibly helpful. Elsewhere, I&#8217;ve been reading of the benefits of the ZFS file system in OpenSolaris. For a rookie in the Linux realm, will the app&#8217;s listed here run on OpenSolaris and how does OpenSolaris compare or contrast with Ubuntu? Ultimately, it boils down to which of the OS&#8217;s allows a newbie to get up and running with minimal Tylenol consumption?</p>

<p>Yes, as I noted <a href="/web/20110806090047/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/05/30/bye-apple" rel="nofollow">a few weeks ago</a>, I bought the Canon PowerShot SD450.  When I plugged the camera into my shiny new install, Ubuntu immediately recognized it and offered to import the photos, which I did, and it worked.  I believe this is the work of <a href="/web/20110806090047/http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">libgphoto2</a>, which is one of those amazing little libraries that does one incredibly useful thing incredibly well and just keeps getting better for free.  Someone out there *really* cares about interfacing with digital cameras, in much the same way that I *really* care about parsing RSS and Atom feeds.</p>

<li id="comment-6785"><p>I&#8217;d give some thought to using something other than Gnome. I use the Ice Window Manager (IceWM) with nautilus turned off, (but available from the taskbar when I need a file/icon manager.) If you don&#8217;t mind hand-editing some configuration files, Idesk will manage your icons and do absolutely nothing else. It saves a lot of overhead.</p>

<li id="comment-6796"><p>@Steve: If you really want to play with an OpenSolaris-based distro, there&#8217;s Nexenta (gnusolaris.org), which attempts to bring an Ubuntu-ish GNOME desktop, Debian packages, and the GNU userland to OpenSolaris. It&#8217;s still a work in progress &#8212; they&#8217;ve got a little more than half of the Ubuntu packages in their repositories, but it&#8217;s not as polished or tightly integrated as more mature distributions. Probably not for most rookies, though.</p>
<p>If you want a distro that Just Works, the answer is at the top of this page: Ubuntu. (In my case, I use Kubuntu with a few GNOME apps like Gaim, though in the end, my list is similar to Mark&#8217;s.)</p>

<li id="comment-6800"><p>Thanks, Ian. With further digging, I see that OpenSolaris with ZFS might be the ticket for a web server, but for a newbie learning Linux, clearly Ubuntu is the better desktop choice. Mark&#8217;s discussion of his software decisions just paves the way for those of us who are clueless.</p>

<li id="comment-6805"><p>I&#8217;m a long-time Debian desktop and server user and I recently installed Kubuntu on my main desktop, just to see what it was like. I have no problems installing Debian (because I&#8217;m used to it and I built all my machines so I don&#8217;t have any hardware compatibility issues) however I spent the rest of the day in shock as Kubuntu installed while I was making coffee, and just worked. Wow. I&#8217;d second the recommendation to try out KMail, it&#8217;s the only mail application that seems to handle my massive IMAP mailboxes properly, I use a Mac at home and Mail on OSX is intolerably slow.</p>

<li id="comment-6808"><p>I tried to make the switch to Linux with SuSE 8.0 a few years back, but it didn&#8217;t stick. I tried Ubuntu on a whim about a month ago and I love it.

I imagine with Sun backing ubuntu on its server line you will see zfs on ubuntu before other linux distros. There was something on the net recently about open sourcing zfs so it is probably a done deal. Rock on!</p>

<p>No.  I believe it just made it into the latest kernel last week.  Better wait until the next release of your favorite distribution; recompiling your own kernel is a lousy introduction to Linux.  I believe the next version of Ubuntu is due out in October.</p>

Since i don&#8217;t have a camera i can&#8217;t really recommend it, but all people i know that use linux just rave about this application.</p>
<p>What i like about your list is the mix of applications from both Gnome &amp; KDE. Most people, like myself, tend to use only applications avaiable to the Desktop Environment they use and somehow end in restricting themselves. You on the other hand went and picked the best of each one and seem to be doing ok :)</p>
<p>Btw, another mention for Tomboy. So simple, yet so amazing.</p>

<li id="comment-6814"><p>Nice list. Thanks. FWIW, I run OpenSuSE, and before that SuSE, as far back as 7.3, as essentially a desktop system / power user. Haven&#8217;t run Windows for other than games for something like three years. two years.</p>
<p>Additions:</p>
<p>- I like a mind mapping tool. Freemind is a good one.</p>
<p>- I also like having a very generic &#8220;stonepile&#8221; manager for collecting notes to self, and pieces of writing in progress (referring to the metaphor in Weinberg&#8217;s book on writing, subtitled &#8220;the Fieldstone Method.) A personal wiki workes nicely for that. I&#8217;m using MoinMoin at the moment.</p>
<p>- Don&#8217;t see OpenOffice. There&#8217;s some griping about it, here and there. Don&#8217;t get that. It works just fine for me.</p>
<p>- Firefox extensions: Bookmark Duplicate Detector, Dictionary search, Sage (vs. feeds other places), and StumbleUpon, for extra time wasting fun.</p>

<li id="comment-6835"><p>&#8220;GNU Emacs, for people who think that the main problem with XEmacs is that it’s too user friendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uh, I guess you are 4 years behind times, approximately.  User friendliness of Emacs went par with 21.1 (at least if you are using X11). But catching up another 4 years is still nice to do, so take the emacs-snapshot-gtk package (it&#8217;s even in Ubuntu universe).  While this is &#8220;unreleased developer software&#8221;, it works quite better than what other people call released.</p>
<p>The main problem with XEmacs nowadays probably is that it can&#8217;t deal well with utf-8.</p>

<li id="comment-6853"><p>I&#8217;ve been using Ubuntu for nearly two years now and these software lists appear stranger and stranger over time.  Nowdays I&#8217;d have to stop and think about which program I was using for any particular task, or even look it up.  Instead it&#8217;s just &#8220;whatever program runs when I open this file&#8221;.  The lists are also strange because they&#8217;re nearly all programs that you can try out in the Applications-&gt;Add/Remove menu or via Synaptic.  If you have too much time on your hands and a reasonable internet connection you can try every music player in the repository to see which one suits your personal tastes best, then remove the ones you don&#8217;t like just by selecting them from the menus.  An actual comparative review of some category would be much more useful than a list of titles.</p>
<p>PS:  If you&#8217;re switching and you want to help out, keep a journal of all the annoying/confusing things and bugs that you find and when you get a better feel for what you&#8217;re doing send the items off to those who can fix them for the next person.</p>

<p>You say &#8220;Quicksilver, only without the plugins&#8221;.  Well, the GNOME Deskbar does plugins, but it just doesn&#8217;t have that many of them&#8230; yet.  And plugin management currently sucks (it&#8217;s copy this .py file that you downloaded from some random geezer&#8217;s website into this secret directory) &#8211; we&#8217;re working on it.</p>

<p>I think it is therefore “Tengo el fuego del sol en mis mutandes”&#8230;</p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;d be *los* pantalones/mutandes, not mis. You can&#8217;t use posessives with articles of clothing.</p>

<p>My other issue is that OS X still doesn&#8217;t do a very good job running X applications.  Emacs and xterm (which only uses about 1M of memory so is a fav of mine) just don&#8217;t work very well.</p>

<li id="comment-6910"><p>This list is proof that you are not an average computer user. </p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t much care which OS they&#8217;re using as long as they can use the tools that they need to get their particular job done. As graphic designer, the limiting factor right now is the poor quality (or complete lack) of professional-quality apps. I mean, GIMP is great as a free application, but itsn&#8217;t even close to being a replacement for Photoshop. </p>
<p>I understand the concern with portability of data and open formats, but I can&#8217;t afford to cut off my nose to spite my face. At this point I feel that my data is portable enough (meaning that I can back it out to portable, open, formats as well now as I&#8217;ll likely be able to in the future) and I&#8217;ve resigned myself to the fact that there will be an ongoing premium expense for using the Mac. I&#8217;m ok with that &#8212; my time is more valuable.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m with Joe Clark: your use of the term mac-fanboy isn&#8217;t up to the quality of the rest of what you have to say.</p>

<li id="comment-6911"><p>I&#8217;ll add Samba, which is essential if there be Windows boxes in your local (or office) network. Takes much of the pain out of maintaining a Windows/Mac/*nix LAN. And apt-get &#8212; keeping your whole system up to date that easily is surely a part of that &#8220;usability&#8221; thing. </p>
<p>Funny thing is that Ubuntu&#8217;s installer for versions 4.10 through 5.10 was actually based on debian-installer, so maybe &#8220;can&#8217;t install Debian&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really apply.</p>

<li id="comment-6914"><p>Hi Mark,<br />
I&#8217;d like to hear about how your folders are set up; Can Ubuntu be set up so most of the commands are the same or do the same things as on a Mac? How about the permissions, so it&#8217;s as secure as a Mac and if you would, talk about how  syncing goes, that is, moving from Mac to Ubuntu.</p>
<p> I have half a dozen Macs and would be willing to sell them all and jump to a linux box if my learning curve would be &#8220;Here&#8217;s the basic Mac architecture, plus all these features, minus these features..for now&#8230;&#8221; I don&#8217;t do web development, so I&#8217;m not so concerned about eye candy as I am about having a familiar feature set &amp; having to spend a lot of time at the command line.</p>

<p><a href="/web/20110806090047/http://qemu.org/" rel="nofollow">QEmu</a> is probably what you&#8217;re looking for.  The base emulator is open source, but there is also a proprietary-but-no-cost add-on called QEmu Accelerator that works much like Parallels does (programs run on the host CPU instead of an emulated CPU).</p>
<p>Or you could download the proprietary-but-freeware VMWare Player and hack the disk image to install Windows.  Search Google for HOWTOs on that.</p>

<li id="comment-6917"><p>After being nearly 100% *n?x (bsd, then linux) since 1993, I just got a macbook pro. Why? Tired of screen issues (can&#8217;t hook up random external display like a projector), power management, and various other persistent and frustrating problems.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have done this if my m200 with Debian hadn&#8217;t been stolen :(, but now I&#8217;ll be able to test things with Windows &amp; MacOS X, so I&#8217;m prioritizing my audience&#8217;s POV as well as my technical/ideological preferences. Oh, and have a slick fast computer.</p>
<p>Anyway that&#8217;s how I justify it, maybe I just want to try something new. :) Often I felt with Gnome that their striving for user friendliness &#8211; through limited, pre made  choices &#8211; was turning the desktop into something I didn&#8217;t want anyway. This is exemplified on both platforms by hiding the terminal under Utilities, whereas its a main application for a lot of users. The other problem with the open source world being the prominant and background apps come and go (hotplug, xine, etc, etc). However, I&#8217;m not going to adopt any non open software (and servers are still Linux based).</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck, and I have little doubt I&#8217;ll be be working my way back once I get sick of the glitz.</p>

<p>Oh, I know Emacs has a powerful gravitational pull, but consider <a href="/web/20110806090047/http://www.nedit.org/" rel="nofollow">NEdit</a>. It has a pretty powerful macro language and rational keyboard equivalents.</p>

<li id="comment-6921"><p>Welcome to Linux, I made the switch from Mac last August and am still enjoying it very much. I did move from Gnome to KDE as the way the GUI works just makes so much more sense to me. I also noticed that you list several KDE applications.</p>
<p>Give Kubuntu a try (ubuntu&#8217;s kde brother).</p>

<p>Installation was simple enough, and most of the programs I used in xp are already installed in Ubuntu.

<p>However</p>
<p>I want to play mpg and avi files, but the package mplayer-686 has an GDebi error(Dependancy is not satisfisble: mplayer) and I cannot figure out how to install gcc 2.95.3 used to compile mplayer source. Does anyone have a step by step howto for a n00b like me?</p>

<li id="comment-6928"><p>&gt; Sure there’s formats for certain applications, but isn’t that how it goes with any environment?</p>
<p>No, really it isn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s nothing preventing an application being written so it stores its data in a non-opaque, well-documented data format.</p>
<p>When applications appear that fail to store all data in open formats, the wise thing to do is avoid them so you keep control of your own data.</p>
<p>When an operating system (or more precisely, its vendor) consistently pushes applications that fail to store all data in open formats, the wise thing to do is escape from that operating system.</p>

<p>This is the sort of comment that just drives me up a wall. Look, if the end point for your data is a digital file, this may, sometimes, makes a modicum of sense. But very often the end of the digital data is printed (whether a photo or a brochure designed in Quark XPress), and sometimes even when the file will be digital the open formats are just plain inferior (jpeg and png). This sort of manifesto-like statement is simpleminded, limiting, and incomplete.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve explained at great length in recent posts, the vast majority of data I&#8217;m creating is personal, private, extremely important (to me), and strictly digital, and I would like to keep it for at least the next 50 years.  This involves a numbers of factors, one of which is open formats.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-6938"><p>> I&#8217;m not ready to wrestle with Linux on a laptop.</p>
<p>Neither am I.  Like all hardware, your best bet is to buy a laptop from a vendor that specifically supports the operating system you want to run on it.  (This is not a Linux-specific problem; look at all the driver problems people are having with the 64-bit version of Windows.)  There are Linux-friendly OEMs out there.</p>

<li id="comment-6945"><p>Well, the first thing I do when I boot up ubuntu, or any other linux distro other than Gentoo, is try to configure the wireless connection. Most of them find the card, but then provide no gui/touchy feely support for connecting to my WPA secured network at home. They apparently assume that everyone has open ESIDs and wireless routers. Neat. Three versions of Ubuntu haven&#8217;t been able to connect to my router. The one time I took the plunge and lovingly compiled Gentoo and manually configured the wireless card (after compiling the drivers no less) I was able to connect to my wireless network. I was so happy. Then the hard drive went tits up.</p>
<p>The second thing I usually do is install the latest version of Fluxbox. I love that WM. Some day I&#8217;ll have to research how to run a different wm under OS X.</p>

<p>I understand that you have minimal requirements for your software, but those who work with professional-grade graphics and video just could not do their work with the software available for Linux. Does that make them fanboys? I wonder why you feel the need to condescend so much. It seems your choices are based on ego and ideology rather than practicality.</p>

<li id="comment-6956"><p>Good to see you&#8217;ve made the switch to Linux.  I&#8217;ve been running linux for years, and have been using it solely at home for over a year now (gentoo).  </p>
<p>Last October my girlfriend bought me an Apple ipod (5g video) for my birthday.  So I tried a handful of iTunes replacements including amaroK gtkpod and rhythmbox which I found to be good but buggy and not quite what I wanted.  gnupod worked quite well but, I found that what was limiting me was the ipod and it&#8217;s itunes index.  I wanted it to operate more like a file browser so I did some digging and found rockbox.</p>
<p>Rockbox is an excellent opensource operating system for a whole variety of mp3 players including the ipod.  It plays mp3, oggs and a whole lot more, and it allows you to store the files on your ipod how you want.  It can easily be mounted in linux, and scripts can easily be written to sync to it.</p>
<p>The only minor problem is that I don&#8217;t think it supports video playback yet.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never looked back.  Rather than using a graphical podcatcher for synchronising podcasts, I opted to cobble together my own solution.  I use podget (a bash script for downloading mp3s) and an XSLT file to strip my bloglines subscription opml to seperate my podcasts from my regular rss items.  I then have another script to sync the files to ipod appropriately.  For me this setup works really well as I can use my bloglines bookmarklet to subscribe to podcasts and have them sync up to my ipod later.</p>
<p>An alternative to rockbox is ipodlinux, which at the time didn&#8217;t properly support the 5g ipod, though I believe progress is being made.</p>

<p>- No Airport Extreme support.<br />
- No Energy-saving/Sleeping mode stuff management.</p>

<li id="comment-6968"><p>Mark, you should consider updating your instructions to use aptitude instead of apt-get. Aptitude remembers and differentiates between the packages you selected for installation and the packages which were installed as dependencies. When you use aptitude to remove a package, it also removes the unused dependencies that were installed with it. Now, if you use apt-get for a while and end up with a lot of extra packages, you can use deborphan to list your orphaned packages, and then remove them manually. But if you use aptitude from the get-go, it will never be a problem.</p>

<li id="comment-6971"><p>Like many people, I have been watching the furor surrounding Mark&#8217;s migration from OS X to ubuntu with interest. I&#8217;ve been a Debian user since the mid nineties, and have several hundred debian servers in production around the world. I have, however, always used apple powerbooks for my portable requirements. OS7-9 were woeful to be sure, but the 3600c and the pismo made fine linux platforms. When I upgraded to a G4 17, I installed OS X for the first time since the developer&#8217;s beta of 10.0 and was glad to see that they had remedied many of the performance problems, disk I/O and VM aside. I lived with tiger since I bought this machine in september, but I&#8217;m a unix user at heart, and OS X is a terrible unix environment. The package management (ports, fink, dmg, blah) make me want to remove my own eyes with something crafted out of stone by a neolithic man.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s a long winded introduction to an answer to a question asked by somebody earlier in the comments. When I removed OS X from my machine, the migration was very straight forward:</p>
<p>*terminal*<br />
(you did enable the root account, right?)<br />
$su -<br />
#cd /Users &amp;&amp; #tar -cvf /Volumes/External_disk/homedir.tar ./my_home_dir<br />
#verify the tarball<br />
*format the disk*<br />
*install ubuntu*<br />
*create the first UID to match your short username on OS X*<br />
*mount the external disk (HFS+ is read fine)*<br />
$su -<br />
#cd /mnt/External_disk<br />
#tar xvf homedir.tar -C /home</p>
<p>&#8230; then weed through the resulting directory removing all of the metadata associated with various OS X applications. There&#8217;s a lot of chaff in the directory listing, and much of it can go the way of the dodo (~me/Library for insance). If you have any shell customisations, these will be tracked over, and you&#8217;ll be able to migrate your media and other important data by associating them with the relevant applications (amaroK etc).</p>
<p>*imo* OS X is probably a poor operating system for anybody who actually uses (X)emacs on a regular basis for anything like development of software. With all the talk from people about a &#8220;killer application for linux&#8221;, it&#8217;s easy enough to point out: emacs is king. It&#8217;s more important to me than photoshop or office or dreamweaver or xcode or just about anything else, and it&#8217;s support in OS X is weak at best. */imo*</p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#8217;t realise how ridiculously easy and quick it is to carry out &#8220;all those endless installations&#8221; on a modern Debian-based desktop like Ubuntu.  I seriously doubt it would have much impact on anyone&#8217;s social life.  On the other hand, it sounds like installing new programs must be a real chore on the Mac for you to leap to this ignorant and erroneous conclusion. </p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s another good reason to consider switching to Ubuntu &#8212; You can actually try out a variety of different programs (rather than using the OS defaults), without giving up your social life trying to get them installed!</p>

<li id="comment-6974"><p>Whee. Fun to watch the fireballs fly.</p>
<p>There are some obvious conclusions:</p>
<p>Both platforms (Mac OS &amp; Linux) have a lot of diversity, strength and weaknesses, and their own issues that affect different people in different ways.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to argue that in nearly every case, free/open source is not the better way, technically and idealistically. *Provided* the system runs well and does what is needed, for a particular user. Statements such as &#8220;Emacs is king&#8221; are just *hilarious* when I think of the average user&#8217;s requirements, especially when compared to specialized apps such as Photoshop (Oh, just write a Lisp macro to speak to GIMP&#8217;s python macros.. you&#8217;ll need Python 2.5.1 installed, not 2.5.2. Just read this 47 page discussion about it here, and join channel #leet-script-fu-splitters and talk to Foobah-the-great about how to get Python to not trip over backslashes. Yeah.) (Yes I know you said IMO, but this attitude still pervades, and I think the four people reading this who use Emacs already know how to switch their OS).</p>
<p>The flames arise when people are inconsiderate of other&#8217;s priorities, for example, having a completely reliable, prebuilt environment without extensive yak-shaving, having full access to their data, a sense of purity, ego/machismo, bad experiences, cultural or technical entrenchment (it *is* hard to reach a plateau). Etc.</p>
<p>Assuming free will (and data lock-in can prevent this), I really don&#8217;t think anyone is &#8220;right&#8221; here, and find it disgusting when people resort to name calling. Mark started the name calling, which sets a disrespectful tone for the rest of the conversation.</p>
<p>Frankly, it is ridiculous. If the computer community can find a way to respond to these differences, that would be at least as great a thing as open source software. Perhaps a cohesive description of a responsible operating system, involving open data formats, etc, etc would be more useful than all this flammage.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-6979"><p>> Firefox memory usage is somehow flawed in version 1.5.x</p>
<p>There were a number of memory leaks in 1.5 which were identified and fixed with the help of a leak detector extension that one of the core developers wrote a few months ago.  But many popular extensions leak memory like a sieve, which gives Firefox a bad name even though it&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>> version 2.0 (alpha versions already available)</p>
<p>You do realize that I&#8217;m a full-time Firefox developer, right?  That link to nightly builds is the second link on my bookmarks toolbar!  I don&#8217;t really recommend nightlies for the general public, though.  Beta 1 is coming out in a few weeks and will be much more stable than some random nightly build.</p>

<li id="comment-6982"><p>Mark,</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t tried that network manager. All the distros I&#8217;ve tried have been KDE oriented, except for Gentoo but I was going for a minimalist system when I installed that one. I&#8217;m using WPA on my network and so far all of the gui wireless managers for linux I&#8217;ve tried only support WEP. I may have to switch back to WEP.</p>
<p>Why am I concerned about gui tools? Well, the people in my life that would be using my computer aren&#8217;t techies so it needs to be easy. IMO, wireless networking doesn&#8217;t get much easier than with OS X. So if a gui wireless manager for Linux doesn&#8217;t at least get me connected to my home network in two or three clicks, I&#8217;m not going to consider it. Heck, even Windows gets that right most of the time. :)</p>

<li id="comment-6999"><p>Update: I just downloaded the ISO for Debian &#8220;Sarge&#8221; NetInst for PowerPC. At 195 Meg, it&#8217;s rather svelte compared to the Xubuntu ISO. I didn&#8217;t see a similar offering from Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used Debian for the PC, as well as a dozen others over the years (I cut my teeth on Slackware 8) ). I&#8217;m really impressed by their package management system, and how it handles dependencies. Once I make a backup of my data, I&#8217;ll give it a whirl.</p>

<li class=me id="comment-7004"><p>> I heard that Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t support wireless internet</p>
<p>Many wireless cards are supported, but not all of them.  This is definitely an area where Linux is struggling to catch up.  The best thing to do is download a &#8220;live CD&#8221; of Ubuntu and boot it on your own laptop.  It won&#8217;t touch your existing hard drive at all &#8212; it does everything off the CD and in memory &#8212; and you can run a full Linux distribution and see whether it supports your hardware.</p>
