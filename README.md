# Dive Into Mark

This is an archive of [Dive Into Mark](http://diveintomark.org/) in Atom format. It was constructed by David Kendal from Google Reader's archive of the RSS feed. As such, we only have the archives going back as far as 2006-03-23 -- the last post from the original Dive Into Mark. (If you can think of some way to reconstruct the archives further back than that, please let me know.)

Thanks to Mark Pilgrim for writing such an eloquent weblog for so many years.
